<p>Leading Human Shaped Organisations</p>
<p>Exploring how leaders can build ‘human-shaped organisations’ by learning from the humanities – that repository of all that is most human.</p>	
<p>Join Tracey, Sam and their guests as they reimagine ways of creating enabling corporate and institutional environments within which everyone - from the most senior to the youngest recruit - can learn and thrive. They consider leadership at an angle rather than head-on – looking through the lens of philosophy, literature, art, history, psychology for new insights, language and approaches.</p>	
<p>In each episode they will host a leading thinker or practitioner from the humanities, and reflect together on how their experience and wisdom can have relevance to those leading organisations through the pandemic.</p>

<p>
What makes us human? — Being human in a digital context
Robin Dunbar (Emeritus Professor of Evolutionary Psychology | Magdalen College, Oxford University)

In this first episode, Tracey Camilleri talks to Prof Robin Dunbar of ‘Dunbar number’ *fame.  He is Emeritus Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Magdalen College, Oxford University. Robin brings his years of research and discovery about what make us human and how these insights can help leaders make better ‘human-shaped’ decisions. The conversations ranges across topics from the importance of triggering the endorphin system – through mechanisms such as laughter - and its positive effect on productivity,  to more pragmatic advice on how leaders can better facilitate virtual meetings and maintain the ‘musical flow’ of conversation to arrive at more satisfaction and connection for their teams.
 
* Dunbar's number (150) is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships — relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person.
