Celebrating Fatherhood as fathers — Conversations with fathers about fatherhood and the fathers day webinar
Maredi Thema (Maredi Technologies | CEO and MTLI | Founder ) Sibusiso Msomi (Managing Director) SJ Thema (Lawyer) Alex Odiekila (Musician/MC)

This episode explores the role of fatherhood, what it means, the importance of having a father, Etc.

Maredi also tells us about the success of the #AllAboutDads2020 webinar on Father's Day, themed #TakeYourThrone 

The concept of #TakeYourThrone is broken down and explained what it means for each father. 

And each father tells us their experiences or perspective on the importance of having a father in one's life because each experience informs the kind of man you become and ultimately the kind of father you are to your kids.

What does being a good father mean? — How do I show up as a father?
Kopano Monyetsane (AWS | Global trade and Compliance Manager)

Key themes 

What does being a good father mean?

 -Defining your throne - what does that mean practically?
- Best way to support your boy or girl child
- What is the difference between raising the different genders?
- When do you say I have done well, what are the key indicators or measures I can use to celebrate myself?
- Where did I learn to be a father?
- Are we raising them to be like us? Or raising them to be their own people?

How do I show up as a father?
- Scrutinizing and examining how you are measuring up as a dad
- Challenge with time : quality time and sharing deliberate moments with your child Vs duration  of time spent with your kids
- The complexity and struggle of juggling being a provider, a nurturer and finding yourself
- Dealing with the father's guilt

Taking  your throne
- What does this mean?
- Fatherhood - a process of doing well Vs destination of doing well - is it the journey or the destination that defines you?
- Clarifying what the process looks like
- Are we too hard on ourselves?
