Global Philanthropy — "...stakeholders, not just shareholders."
Colleen Ebbitt (J.P. Morgan | Vice President for Global Philanthropy EMEA)

Colleen and I met in 2019 and I walked away so impressed with her work and remarkable views of the world; her brief bio below speaks for itself. In this conversation we covered so much; her history and JP Morgan's philanthropical efforts in South Africa (not many folks know that they're behind several high profile initiatives over here).

I pushed Colleen on her BREXIT work, angles on inclusive economic growth versus capitalism, social enterprises, definition of 'value' and we covered the philosophical (and controversial) aspects of philanthropy.

A casual chat that surfaces her fascinating posits. What a privilege to spend this time interviewing another incredible woman making a global impact!

Enjoy!

P.S. The book mentioned can be found via the link below.

Colleen Ebbitt has oversight for philanthropic grants supporting more inclusive economic growth in South Africa, Switzerland, Sweden and Turkey.

Colleen joined from the UK Government’s Inclusive Economy Unit where she was a Senior Policy Advisor specializing in innovative social finance and social enterprises. 

Colleen was also on temporary assignment as team lead in EU Exit data management as well as EU strategy.

She spent 9 years as a Vice President private banker at J.P. Morgan in Switzerland and the United States managing wealth for individuals and family offices. She was a 2015 LGT Impact Ventures Fellow working on strategic growth initiatives for a sub-Saharan African maternal HIV/AIDS charity, mothers2mothers, based in South Africa. Colleen is a frequent public speaker and champion for impact investment and gender empowerment.

Making sense of 'Resilience' — Approaching any challenge an allowing it to enhance you! - Taryn Stejskal
Taryn Marie Stejskal Ph.D. (Resilience Leadership | (CRO) Chief Resilience Officer)

Resilience' is the new, global, C-suite buzzword and what an honour to present to you the leading mind within this emerging, critical, strategic practice.

I met Taryn Marie recently when we jointly keynoted on a global webinar and what I heard from her finally made 'resilience' make sense; from EQ (emotional intelligence) to AQ (adaptability) to RQ (resilience quotient)!

She is a foremost international expert on resilience, in leadership and life. She is also the former Head of Executive Leadership Development and Talent Strategy at Nike.

Who wouldn't want the privilege and honour of speaking to this remarkable woman?! 

Enjoy!!

Woman pioneering science — Leading female scientists' journey and fascinating perspectives
Rachel Chikwamba (CSIR-Leadership Industrial Development | Group Executive and active member of the Academy of Science of South Africa)

Finally managed to corner Rachel and now you all have the opportunity to listen to this incredible scientist and thought leader. I serve on the board of the CSIR and it is always such a privilege to engage Rachel in that capacity.

She leads some of the most jaw-dropping scientific research projects and here she provides you with a glimpse into them.

Her life story & career path contains so many learnings and lessons.

Rachel's perspectives on COVID-19, plant genetics, leadership, mentorship...through to her philosophical stance on global topical matters is so insightful.

Another great woman doing globally impactful things in the world of scientific research & invention.

Loved this interview, you'll hear why I'm such a fan and why Rachel is my most favourite scientist.

<p>
Female entrepreneurship — A truly successful, inventive, African (woman) and tech entrepreneur
Arlene Mulder (Entrepreneur | WeThinkCode and BiB | Co-Founder)

I first met Arlene when she reached out to me about a crazy idea; establish an entity that could identify and truly uplift disadvantaged (even uneducated) humans by giving them a free shot at becoming a skilled computer programmer.

Since those early stage discussions she launched 'WeThinkCode' which did exactly this and has already transformed the lives of over ONE THOUSAND individuals...and continues to increment this today.

The impact of that vision is probably one of the most successful (and impactful) startup stories in the South African ICT sector! Women leadership!

Obviously she was on my list of incredible woman to showcase this season. Her history and the challenges she outlines, specifically related to female tech entrepreneurship, are revelatory!

This discussion allowed me to ask her the dumb-guy questions and her reverts every male will find valuable! If you’re a woman thinking of venturing into the startup scene, Arlene shares very useful insights.

Arlene is launching another startup; BiB (see link below) and she once again articulates the related conviction - inspirational - can’t wait to see what this does for undiscovered African authors and creative talent.

Female leadership personified — A woman's fascinating executive journey, challenges, and lessons
Jacqui O'Sullivan (MTN | Communication and Reputation Management Executive)

This is one my favourite interviews to-date; I absolutely loved Jacqui's posits, experiences and perspectives!

We covered so many areas in this episode : 5G, WFH, BLM, EQ, PR vs Marketing, global female leadership, Etc. But, what I found most profound is Jacqui's description of the challenges women experience in the corporate (South African) environment and her perspective on traditional (masculine) leadership.

* If you are a man - this one is for you!
* If you're a woman - this one has so many lessons and learnings.
* If you're a parent of teenagers or young adults - please have your kid(s) join and listen to this with you.

I personally learnt so much - little nugget; ""...men tend to solve the problem...but don't always consider the people""...within the context of human focused leadership.

Enjoy!!

State of (our) nations — An incredible woman's take on our sociopolitical landscape
Ferial Haffajee (Daily Maverick | Associate Editor | Author and Award-winning Journalist)

We start off season 2 themed (in conversations with) 'Incredible Women' and Ferial Haffajee was one of the first names that came to mind. My entire family are massive fans of her work and career, and I fervently follow her writings. This interview was a huge honour, privilege and very timely considering the worries that all South African's have today about our country.

We explore Ferial's early childhood growing up in Bosmont (a Johannesburg 'Coloured area') and how that has influenced her career and tenacity. But, we quickly branch into her views regarding South Africa's political landscape, rampant corruption, Etc.

My questions were focused on the topics all of us are currently surfacing:
'Is there a future for South Africa?'
'Should we stay in the country?'
'Why does our President seem so inept in dealing with the adversities?'
'Why isn't anyone going to jail due to the corruption?'
and more...

As usual, Ferial fascinates with insightful responses and her perpetual South African positivity - I loved this conversation!

Not only is this an incredible woman but also one of THE top journalists our country has produced.

HR during a pandemic — What do you do when your staff test C19 positive and die?
Professor Shirley Zinn (Non-Exec Director of Boards, Author of 'Swimming Upstream', Coach, Mentor, and Entrepreneur)

Human Resource (HR) executives have found themselves in the corporate nucleus of this pandemic storm. COVID-19, WFH...through to 'Black Lives Matter' are rocking the foundations of every business - crazy times which HR folks have to orchestrate.

Shirley is considered the leading HR exec in South Africa and after a friendly catch-up call, which FLOORED me, I decided that we just had to do this recording.

Herein she articulates real-world challenges associated with that dreaded confirmation that your staff member, or team, have tested COVID-19 positive. What do you do? What do you say? What if one or several of them die? - she describes examples of organizations and leaders getting it right and those that just do not.

Leadership, organizational restructuring, compensation, performance management, employee wellness...SO so so many fascinating learnings in here!

Shirley's transversal experiences/insights into what companies are grappling with today are real-world, tangible, frightening and practical.

Goosebumps!!

Origins of Africa's arterial Internet veins — An audacious marine-fibre project to reticulate Africa's eastern seaboard
Brian Herlihy (SEACOM | Founder, Black Rhino Group | Founder, and World Economic Forum’s (WEF’s) 192 Young Global Leaders for 2012)

Imagine deciding that you're going to connect Africa to the Internet...then actually going out and doing it! Well, my friend Brian did just that and I managed to catch up with him and capture some of the history of the founding of SEACOM.

He shares the fascinating origins of his endeavour, the challenges of laying a few (hair thin) strands of glass all the way down our eastern seaboard and the challenges of maintaining it all. 

Brian also surfaces his thoughts on the present state, and future(s), of the Internet's African topology.

The impact SEACOM has had in Africa, specifically South Africa, has been tectonic; we finally connected to the real Internet backhaul, it collapsed prices, increased bandwidth capacity and performance, and totally altered the economics of our telecoms industry.

The empowering business and human impact Brian's project has had on the continent is perhaps immeasurable; what a legacy, what a story and this is how it all started.

<p>
Philosophies of technology's future — What if we are just AI's biome and Bitcoin married IOT?
Scott Lemon (Technologist, Futurist, and Twilio IOT Solutions Engineer)

My favourite 'Lemon' quote (which he coined about 20 years ago!); 'The Internet is the developing nervous system of the human organism on Earth!'

Scott Lemon has an incredible technological 'sixth sense' and since I met him when I lived in Utah (where he still abides nestled in the Wasatch mountain range in Heber Valley) in 1997 he's been my go-to for seeing around technological bends (or just verifying whether my assumptions makes sense).

We reminisce about some of the world-first things I watched him do back then; setting up the first ever 802.11x wifi network at a Brainshare conference in the USA, exploring directory services as a consumer service (perhaps the first derivative of the social graph), etc.

Scott also casually shares his fascinating views on what's ahead with IOT, voice as a user interface, Bitcoin allowing sensors to exchange value, humans being the 'gut bacteria' of an emerging sentience, Etc.

What a privilege to shoot the breeze with such a special friend!

Bitcoin Understood and Contextualized — Bitcoin's history, status today, and futures beautifully articulated
Farzam Ehsani (VALR | 'Bitcoin Seer', Co-Founder and CEO)

Farzam (or Zom as I know him) is my 'go-to' guy for all things Bitcoin and crypto-currency. His faith, respect for history and ability to assimilate the humanities, gives him the ability to contextualize Bitcoin better than anyone I've heard or met. In this episode we explore the evolution of money, the current state of the fiat-currency world and demystify Bitcoin. He also maps his journey out of traditional banking and into building his own Bitcoin exchange : VALR

Bitcoin Understood and Contextualized — Bitcoin's history, status today, and futures beautifully articulated
Farzam Ehsani (VALR | 'Bitcoin Seer', Co-Founder and CEO)

Farzam (or Zom as I know him) is my 'go-to' guy for all things Bitcoin and crypto-currency. His faith, respect for history and ability to assimilate the humanities, gives him the ability to contextualize Bitcoin better than anyone I've heard or met. In this episode we explore the evolution of money, the current state of the fiat-currency world and demystify Bitcoin. He also maps his journey out of traditional banking and into building his own Bitcoin exchange : VALR

The dynamic (European) future of work — Fascinating WFH stats and insights into security challenges/opportunities
Jesper Frederiksen (Okta, Inc | Vice President and General Manager, EMEA)

Jesper and I first met when I established Google's presence here in South Africa (2006). We've been friends ever since and I've always highly regarded his insights into technology trends. Here he shares this fascinating 'Work From Home' (WFH) European study done by OKTA. The posits are fascinating and gives us some useful insights re the metamorphosis occurring right now throughout the region. His OKTA vantage point gives him frontline views of the future of work unfolding; what a privilege to hear it directly from Jesper.

Geeks Reminiscing — Looking back over aged (tech) shoulders
JD Marymee (Microsoft HQ Seattle | Applied Innovation Architect, Professional Flight Instructor and Author)

JD and I met in the USA in 1996 when I started working at Novell’s Utah (Provo) HQ. His tech background and experience is jaw-dropping! JD’s history covers some of the most pivotal technology milestones in our industry and the various pioneers he engaged during those times.

Listen in as we casually throw back to some of those fascinating instances, do some BIG name dropping and he shares his views on Blockchain.

Unfortunately I couldn’t keep him talking longer (because he had to jump on a call with NASA and Starlink) but I’m sure (the older) geeks out there will love hearing some of this tech history.

Consider this Part I : I promise to bring him back to surface more of this history chronologically. There is SO much he still has to share!

The reinventor of education — Inventive entrepreneurship, founder PTSD and next generation learning
Robert Paddock (GetSmarter | Co-founder, Valenture Institute | CEO, Hubble Studios | Executive Director, Injini | Board Member)

From a drummer who almost lost his hearing, to logistics, to compost, to disrupting the education sector; Rob shares his pathways that led to one of the biggest deals in SA's startup sector history (an exit of $103m plus $20m cash when he sold the Cape Town based education platform, GetSmarter, to a USA company, 2U, in 2017).

If you're a budding entrepreneur, this is for you; Rob has had a fascinating and meandering startup journey and he articulates so many learnings from it.

If you're a parent with kids entering/in high-school, this is for you; Rob's insights into this sector and the future he is actually building today, specifically via the Valenture Institute, every parent should heed. In this COVID-19 dispensation we are accelerating the metamorphosis of education which will have tectonic impacts on society.

If you're an experienced founder, this is for you; We share our stories of building something you've invented and then having to let it go. Posits related to psychological hardships that we simply do not expound enough as founders. (Inventive entrepreneurship can be an abyss of sacrifice, forced confrontations with your shadow and ultimately with your identity and depression(s). Everyone focuses on the success but many do not lift the veil to see the impact and consequences some founders have to wrestle long after.)

In summary; Rob is just an awesome dude and I hope this casual and unscripted conversation, which was such a privilege, holds nuggets of learnings for all.

Early childhood development and COVID-19 — Parents of toddlers - heads up! Amazing insights, guidance, and advice!
Meg Faure (Occupational Therapist, Author, Speaker and Founder of 'Play Sense')

Parents in COVID-19 lockdown (and in general) are extremely concerned about their child's development. Many of us are stuck at home with toddlers, multi-tasking, exhausted, and out of ideas. Amongst ourselves we're asking serious questions about their growth, well-being, the future of day-care and their overall education.

I turned to my favourite OT and one of the smartest educationalist on the planet; Meg Faure has done incredible work authoring best-selling books, started successful businesses in this domain and is a thought-leader.

Enjoy her sharing so many invaluable and practical nuggets of parental advice for us in lock-down (which will be equally invaluable post lock-down).

BTW, listen out for the bit where she articulates pivoting her 'Play Sense' business due to the lock-down - fascinating share and learnings every Founder out there will find useful.

<p>
The upside of down in Bruce Whitfield's world — Perspectives making sense of our new world; historically and economically
Bruce Whitfield (A multi award-winning business broadcaster, journalist, author, speaker, MC and conference facilitator)

Bruce Whitfield (@brucebusiness) doesn't need any introduction if you're a South African (for the few who don't know him; see his bio below). I love prompting Bruce for his views which are usually fascinating, verbose, contextual and wrapped in beautiful historical metaphors.

I 'cold-called' him this morning and (completely unscripted) he shared his views re the pandemic, the world economy, South Africa and where this is all heading. Wonderfully positive perspectives that left me hopeful of our future.

He also shamelessly and typically (*wink*) plugged his new best-selling book (see link below to purchase it).

Bruce's bio : A multi-platform award-winning financial journalist, Bruce’s work on radio, television and in print gives him unique access to South Africa’s biggest power brokers in business and money. He has been named ‘Financial Journalist of the Year’ three times in the past decade by independent judges in the annual Sanlam Awards, and has received recognition for his work on the economy, companies and personal finance.
</p>
<br />
<p>The article he authored that we mention <a href="https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/opinion/2020-05-13-bruce-whitfield-dear-minister-patel-let-me-tell-you-whats-unfair-/?utm_source=Solid%20Gold%20Podcast&utm_medium=Episode%20Description%20Stafford%20Unplugged">https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/opinion/2020-05-13-bruce-whitfield-dear-minister-patel-let-me-tell-you-whats-unfair-/</a></p>

Digital, Innovation, Humanity and the Virus! — True invention and innovation only exist when people are having fun
Lee Naik (TransUnion Africa | CEO | LinkedIn Top Voice | Columnist | Speaker)

Lee and I shoot the breeze on his thoughts about this new world order and where he thinks we are. We've known each other for many years so much is said between the lines but I'm sure you will enjoy the chat.

He also shares some amazing nuggets re their TransUnion findings

My key take-away : Joy, Re-invention & innovation of self is key to this new dispensation.

The economic disaster of COVID-19! — Our money, businesses and world finances are incinerating - now what?
Dr. Adrian Saville (Chief Executive at Cannon Asset Managers and Prof of Economics, Finance and Strategy at the Gordon Institute of Business Science)

Adrian is my 'go-to' person when the economic world just does not make sense - he is that for many institutions too — this discussion will show you why!

In today's upside down Covid-19 world I ask Adrian to decipher what's happening, to attempt a forecast of what lies ahead and what he would do if he were President.

I level many (controversial) questions at him including the topical and critical 'death by starvation versus death by virus?' - fascinating perspectives!

Education and governance in a COVID-19 world — Amazing insights and observations for our new and strange world!
Professor Jonathan Jansen (Distinguished Professor of Education at Stellenbosch University and President of the Academy of Science of South Africa)

Prof JJ and I casually shoot the breeze generally talking about the Corona virus, the situation globally and in South Africa, and the state of education in this new Covid-19 dispensation.

As usual the Prof's views are insightful and thought-provoking.
