Give a present that Pops for Christmas! — Regreening Africa the Greenpop way
Misha Teasdale (Co-founder and Director at Greenpop

Planet deforestation and carbon emissions have become watchwords in the global environment and economy. Our new ‘climate-reality’.

Flower Power — Garden Day SA - Growing Memories
Gundula Deutschlander (Master Gardener, Garden Day Ambassador)

Garden Day SA on Sunday 11th October, is the perfect day to invite friends and family to celebrate your garden and green spaces with you.  

Master Gardener Gundula Deutschlander, one of the Garden Day ambassadors, gives us the lowdown on why gardening is good for you, and what is happening around this Glorious Green event. 

Conscious that we are still social distancing and that some people can’t even in fact go outside, this year the organisers are hosting the first ever Virtual Garden Day Gathering.

Flower Power — Garden Day SA - Growing Memories
Gundula Deutschlander (Master Gardener, Garden Day Ambassador)

Garden Day SA on Sunday 11th October, is the perfect day to invite friends and family to celebrate your garden and green spaces with you.  

Master Gardener Gundula Deutschlander, one of the Garden Day ambassadors, gives us the lowdown on why gardening is good for you, and what is happening around this Glorious Green event. 

Conscious that we are still social distancing and that some people can’t even in fact go outside, this year the organisers are hosting the first ever Virtual Garden Day Gathering. The line-up includes a host of events, such as garden-inspired gourmet with Karen Dudley, a flower crown-off with comedian Schalk Bezuidenhout and a QandA session with garden guru Tanya Visser amongst others. This will all take place via Zoom and Facebook Live.  In the lead up to Garden Day, they will also be hosting a number of virtual events flower crown making workshops and how to prepare for your Garden Day celebration.

Win Win Win! — Be a Green Winner Wena
Michaela Rowley (VegePod SA)

Now that spring is sprung, the rains have come and we’re all itching to get our fingers into the soil, what better way to celebrate being Green than with the opportunity to win a healthy hamper of Green Goodies! 

This Spring promotion is happening from the 7 - 16 October 2020, and includes some great stuff from not only Vegepod, but from Jane’s Delicious Garden, 6 Degrees East and others. 

Vegepod’s Michaela Rowley tells us how you can enter, and more about how to grow your own if you’re strapped for space.

Teach a Man to Grow Fish — Scaling Up The Wonderful Cycle of Life
Justin Hess (Ichthys Aquaponics | MD)

It used to be hydroponics was just a nod, nod, wink, wink, word for pot growing.

Now it is accepted by consumers as a preferred method of growing high-quality food.

Taking it one step further in Johannesburg, Ichthys Aquaponics have cast their line into the water and under the leadership of keen fisherman and g grower Justin Hess, set up a fish/farm which not only supplies great fresh produce, but also help those on a quest for sustainable food security to set up their own system at home. 

And why are we loving it? Well, because we can grow food right where it’s going to be eaten. 

They have also joined forces with Eastgate Mall in creating a rooftop farm, utilising waste space for growing - the first to be set up on top of a shopping mall. The Aquaponics Farm District aims to create a hub to educate local communities on alternative farming methods, showcasing how aquaponics is the future of sustainable farming. 

Hear why more and more people are turning to this method of Urban Farming...

Spring has Rounded the Corner — Time for Some Summer Fun!
Cary Goodwin (Spokesperson Life is a Garden and headgirl at Colourful Group)

Lockdown gave us time to prepare for spring in the garden - and now it’s upon us, it’s time to get geared up for Summer. It’s a busy month out there. What with It being Arbor Month!

Trees are very much on our minds, and Cary a Goodwin of Life is a Garden tells us what we should be looking at planting, regardless of the space you have available. 

With Heritage Day in the offing, we also have a look at heritage plants in our country. And take yo on a seedling safari. 

And don’t forget - Garden Day on 11 October. You have time to grow some lovely green presents for friends and family and plan your flower coronet...

Summer Treasure Hunt! — Blooming Marvellous Bulbs
Charles Barnhoorn (Hadeco Bulbs | CEO)

Rudyard Kipling May have said - Gardens are not made by singing 'Oh, how beautiful,' and sitting in the shade - but sometimes gardens are made by things hiding in the shade. 

Over the years, people eagerly await the heralds of spring, the beautiful array of winter bulbs that show their lovely heads the moment the ground temperature has warmed. 

For those who miss the spring boat, there’s no reason not to have a beautiful Summer garden, considering the wealth of floral treasures now available. 

Charles Barnhoorn, leading expert and grower, gives us and update on what’s new and exciting in their range, how to make sure you get the best from your edibles, and how to create a blooming marvellous space, whatever size it is.

Simply Delicious! — Catching up with the Delicious Jane Griffiths
Jane Griffiths (Author | Jane’s Delicious Garden and many others!)

Delicious Jane is a writer, television producer, traveller and artist, who began her journey to becoming a ‘veggie garden guru’ due to her being inspired chef who very seldom cooks the same recipe twice - and was frustrated about not finding the special ingredients she wanted. However, we find out that this ardent trip-taker’s favourite  journey is from her organic vegetable garden to her kitchen.

With a ‘new’ herb book just released, and another in the offing, Jane gives us the benefit of her knowledge, having found out mostly the hard way what works and what doesn’t. From the basics of ‘no-dig’ gardening, to what you should be planting out now, and the realisation by so many people that growing your own is something we should all be doing, Jane’s got the know-how and the inspiration for you...

O-Live The life you Dream — How to become a master urban farmer
Malcolm Gooding (The Voice | Gooding's Grove Olive Farm | Owner)

Over the last decade or so, the demand from the public to know exactly where their food is coming from and how sustainable it is has had a fairly large impact many stores And what they stock. 

And the demand to grow our own edibles has grown too. Garden centres and growers have heeded the call and a wide range of fruits and veg are now to be found on the shop floor. 

Sometimes, however, there’s a desire to take it even further, to get away from the perceived rat-race and to become a ‘gentleman farmer’. 

Well known and often recognised for his inciting voice, now-ace olive farmer Malcolm Gooding gives us the do’s and dont’s when it comes to growing your own, while catching us up on what else he’s up to in his life.

Dare we say it? Spring’s around the corner — Getting prepared for warmer weather!
Cary Goodwin (Spokesperson Life is a Garden, Headgirl at Colourful Group and Peebles Plants)

Yes, we can feel it in the air - but spring is still hiding its Colourful head - for now. 

It’s the time to get yourself and your garden prepared for warmer weather - NOT to do things like top dressing your lawn. 

As impatient creatures, humans are always racing the clock to get things done. But Nature has her own pace when it comes to plants. Continue the slower pace that Lockdown should have taught us and plan properly for the change in seasons. 

Cary Goodwin gives us all the know-how we need to ensure that you get the best out of your backyard space. And all the tips you need to do it at the right time - and the reasons why. 

We also look at what indigenous fruits to plant to give you, and wildlife, a smorgasbord of new tastes.

Waste not, Want not — Waste minimisation. And what really happens to waste?
Colleen du Toit (Abstract Waste | Founder and CEO)

Many of us don’t give much thought to what happens to all the stuff we discard. Fortunately, with landfills filling up almost to full capacity, those environmentally conscious amongst us are working on ways to lessen our impact when it comes to tossing rubbish. By having bokashis, worm bins and composters at home, and recycling and upcycling. 

Ever thought, though, how businesses go about dealing with their waste? Colleen du Toit of Abstract Waste lets us know what they’re doing to help companies get rid of food waste safely and efficiently.

Saving Our Environment — Reducing Business’s Impact on Nature
Eckart Zollner (EDS Systems | Head of Business Development)

Climate change is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges to threaten the existence of mankind and an issue that the SA Government is attempting to tackle head on. 

This is not just a governmental issue however - businesses need to come to the party too. The 5th June saw World Environment Day placing emphasis on restoration of nature, and how we can all lessen our carbon footprints - something we saw changing worldwide with the lockdowns in place during the global Covid pandemic. 

Eckart Zollner discusses the effects of greenhouse gases on nature and the environment and the importance of embracing saving our natural world.

Life is a Garden — Make your Garden a Reflection of your Life
Cary Goodwin (Spokesperson for Life is a Garden, Peebles Plants and Colourful Group)

Winter is a time when many people hang out indoors, leaving their garden to fend for itself. However, winter is a great time for taking stock of what’s going on in your own backyard. Cary and Melanie chat about ways to make your space work for you, How to get your groove back by putting your back into the work, and about what to be planting in the winter months around South Africa.

Life is a Garden — Make your Garden a Reflection of your Life
Cary Goodwin (Spokesperson for Life is a Garden, Peebles Plants and Colourful Group)

Winter is a time when many people hang out indoors, leaving their garden to fend for itself. However, winter is a great time for taking stock of what’s going on in your own backyard. Cary and Melanie chat about ways to make your space work for you, How to get your groove back by putting your back into the work, and about what to be planting in the winter months around South Africa.

Switching on your garden — Preparing for a burst of spring colour with Bulbs - turn it on!
Charles Barnhoorn (Hadeco Bulbs | MD) and Michael Rickhoff (Master Designer)

Gardening during lockdown has been something of a trial for those who love to plant. But with the opening of Garden Centres for trade, this is the time to not only look at what food plants to get your hands on, but also to prepare your garden - and life - for brighter times ahead. 

May is the time to plant bulbs as ground temperatures have decreased sufficiently. Charles Barnhoorn gives us all the tips and tricks to get the best from these true treasures, he it in the garden or indoors.

In this challenging time of the Covid-19 (SARS-CoronaVirus-2) outbreak, with people being encouraged to self-isolate as much as possible, we must remember that essential services need to be kept running. Many services are under major pressure, one of which is the South African National Blood Service. 

With people working from home, schools and universities closed, and fewer visitors to Shopping centres where they do blood drives, blood donations have dropped to a point where national blood banks have only enough for three days. 

This means there won't be enough blood for those who really need it - for those involved in accidents, for those undergoing operations or those having transfusions. 

Dr Pheello Lethola, Lead Consultant for Blood Donor services, is on hand to tell us why it's safe to continue giving blood, and the steps the SANBS are taking to ensure your safety, while ensuring we can save lives.

Winners - not binners.

That was the first thought when finding out what Winnie 'Upcycle' McHenry was up to. 

Landfills are filling up to capacity. There's plastic pollution in our oceans. The 70s and 80s notion of 'consume, consume, consume' is not only outdated, but should be outlawed! 

Fortunately there are some people who are doing something drastic (and not just by cutting the plastic). 

Winnie holds close to the thought - 
Don't throw away. It can be used in some other way. And she's training people - up-skilling them - to think the same and how to do the same. And create their own businesses. 

She shares with us how we, and corporates, can be less wasteful and more environmentally conscious, and creative with the waste we create.

From soil to supper, Gardening had its ups and downs. With people getting back to their roots and coming down to earth, the want to know more about how to grow your own or to enhance your livings space - and your life - has become a must have. 

As numbers of people entering into horticulture and landscaping worldwide have dwindled, the demand for people who are able to create beautiful working works of art outside, or those who are able to provide food security, has grown exponentially. 

Lifestyle College in Johannesburg is the only non-university learning facility that offers qualifications in Hirt and garden design. Michael Rickhoff runs us through what it's all about, what to expect and how a career in the Green industry - no matter your age - is a growth industry!

October is the month of the King (or should that be Queen) of the plant world to make themselves known in SA. 

Roses are the plant that conjure up visions of love, not just through their good looks, but the memories their scent evoke... 

Long thought by many to be particularly pernickity, difficult to grow and in need of far too much attention, Roses have proven their worth in water scarce gardens around the country. As one of the top Rose breeders in the country, Anja Taschner demystifies the lore of these beauties, and tells us more about the latest Named Rose to come from their stable in honour of Thuli Madonsela.

Known as a totally organic gardener, Designer Debbie Smit (Lecturer at Lifestyle College and owner of Foxgloves Landscape Design) gives us her take on how to be an ethical and healthy gardener, by not using any poisons or chemicals in your backyard. We also get into how and why people should be getting out into the natural world to better their own health, and get up close and personal to sort out problems that may be happening in the garden before they become catastrophes.

Making as small an impact on the environment is something we should all be aware of. And children are getting in on the action, not taking their lead from the wasteful generation ahead of them. Roots and Shoots, an organisation created by Chimpanzee saviour - and now global eco warrior,Jane Goodall, has been implementing projects aimed at getting children involved in recycling, upcycling and all things environmental, not just in SA, but across the world. National coordinator for the South African arm of the organisation, Rita Groenewald, gives us the Good News from their perspective, and ideas on how we can all get involved.

Bright Blue Swimming Pools are a dated symbol of pride. Along with swathes of lawn - those 'green deserts' that so many people spend so much time and money and water on - chlorinated or saline pools are on their way out. Rather than filling in a pool which you just seem to be filling with money and chemicals, rather consider being eco-chic and converting it into a wetland wonderland. One-time architect, Anthony Philbrick, explains what goes into creating one, and why we should be kinder to the environment, and ourselves.

In this episode Adolph van Der Westhuizen (Sales and Marketing Manager Reinforced Hosing and Watex) talks to host Melanie Walker about the benefits of vertical gardening. How small spaces are given and can give life to a dull area life by creating living walls. With the Watex Expandable Green Wall Kit you can enhance that area that is crying out for a bit of TLC and life. The kit is easy to install, it has its own drip irrigation system with the option to attach to a hose pipe, its neat and clean looking as well as robust in its durability. The wonderful thing about the Watex Expandable Green Wall Kit is that should you be in a rental all you have to do is unclip it from its bracket supplied or if you want to move your wall kit to another spot it is as simple as 1 2 3. The kits are ideal for grow and eat plants. Vertical gardens are fantastic towards helping towards climate change and also if you don’t want your pets peeing on your herbs and leafy greens.

According to the SA State of Waste Report, in 2017 South Africans generated 42 million tons of general waste. Only 4.9 million tons of that were recycled. We have one of the worst recycling rates in the world. It's no longer up to the government or municipalities to deal with the waste WE'RE creating - it's up to us to get with the recycling programme. But do you know the difference between reusing, recycling and upcycling? Not? Then listen here! You can be the difference you want to see in the world...

No longer the preserve of the green and greyish brown, the winter garden will warm even the most stony cockles of the heart. If you're wondering how to bring colour and warmth back into your life during the drab colder months, look no further than the 4 Ps. Poppies, pansies, primulas and petunias will be your best bets... Well, through in a few other Ps, like Sweet Peas and a VIP - violas - and you've got a smorgasbord of deliciousness. Peter gives us all the tips you need to ensure floriferousness and longevity from all these very giving and forgiving beauties.

We're used to hearing about how well our Kirstenbosch and Durban exhibits have done at events like the Chelsea Flower Show. Now it's time to bring them home - and make the Joburg Flower Show an event to make other countries green with envy. For five glorious days, Waterfall City will be hosting some of the top garden designers and plant and floral experts from not just all around SA, but from the garden stars overseas. Mike Sham, organised of the event, lets us know here on Grounded just how it's all going to work, and what we can expect in late October. Www.joburgflowershow.co.za

Slightly cooler mornings and evenings may be heralding the beginning of autumn around the country, but the sun is still hot and sitting high in the sky, with no great hurry to set at the end of the day, so we should make the most of this beautiful weather by nurturing our gardens. If you can't wait to get your hands dirty, Cary Goodwin of Life is a Garden has a great guide to what you should be planting and doing in your outdoor rooms. Stars of the month are Tulbaghia (wild garlic). Pride of India and Hibiscus. There's hints on how to get and keep your pets healthy with herbs, and tips on how to keep little hands busy during the school holidays. www.lifeisagarden.co.za

The Polyphagus Shothole Borer (PSHB) (Euwallacea fornicatus - and isn't that just a fitting name for the little fornicator) - or the Vietnamese borer as many know it - has been causing the death of many trees, not just in Johannesburg, but around the rest of the country. And it’s finally getting serious ‘airtime’ in the press and social media, even though Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo have put forward a press release which was published recently in the Rosebank Killarney Gazette to say that ‘it’s too early to classify the outbreak of PSHB as a disaster’ due to a lack of data, and that they reckon we’re at the ‘tail-end of the outbreak’... and guided by research findings they hope to confirm that this outbreak is on its way out. Well, unfortunately that’s not so. The ‘outbreak’ was given wide coverage a year or more ago, and unfortunately, no cure for it has been found, and even more disturbingly, CoJ has yet to identify a place or put in place plans to get rid of infected wood. We are looking at what could potentially be one of SA’s largest ecological tragedies. The private sector has done so much in creating public awareness. Arborists are also getting on board to help find a solution. And it’s time for us to do our part too. One of SA's top arborists and tree surgeons, Julian Ortlepp gives us the background, and advice on how we can help to minimise this potential disaster.

Show gardens are probably the best way for people to get great ideas on how to bling up their outdoor spaces. And a touch of je ne  sais quois is on offer in this year's 7 French inspired spaces. Celebrating the 500th anniversary of the Renaissance, students under the tutelage of master designer Mike Rickhoff have encapsulated various aspects of French joie de vivre. From the rolling lavender fields, to pavement cafes around a town square and contemporary rooftop living, there's inspiration aplenty. The gardens are on show until the end of May, so plenty of time to visit them. And if you aren't able to, we discuss ways to bring that special esprit into your backyard

If you ever wondered if magic happens, all you need to do is look to seeds. That's what Sean Freeman of <a href=https://livingseeds.co.za/?utm_source=Solid%20Gold%20Podcast">Living Seeds</a> found out and is spreading the word on his internet based resource. The story behind Livingseeds goes back over 30 years. As a young boy Sean remembers collecting seeds, if he came across a tree that was shedding seed pods or wild flower in seed, he’d collect the seeds and store them in a small wooden box. This wooden box (which he still has) amassed a surprisingly large collection of assorted and unknown seeds over many years.  None were catalogued or named and he could only identify a handful of the really distinctive ones, the rest were indiscriminate and held his dream of germinating them.... one day. He kept them just for the idea that they could literally grow into trees or plants that could one day be used in his garden. It was the romance of ‘growing a garden from scratch’ that kept him collecting. That and the idea that there exists the potential of life and the ability of giving sustenance in every single seed. Fast forward, and the fascination became a life. Livingseeds started off in 2009 with only 34 varieties on their website (although there were only 17 in stock). They now list over 400 varieties and grow well over 600 varieties on their own property every year. If you're fascinated by the possiblities of growing your own, using open pollinated varieties, don't miss this episode of Grounded...

From rats in your kitchen to bats in your belfry, they have measures that will ensure you don't poison your environment or all the good critters you'd like to invite in.

Ever ask how and why certain varieties make it to market and others don’t. The process of trialing is how. Plant trialing is not only an integral part of the green industry but it’s important for the consumer. Testing plants in varying parts of the country allows the breeders to make better decisions about what will look good and grow in the landscape and also allows the growers to decide what works best for their business and their cultural practices. We take a 'walk' through the process and highlight the upcoming plant trials at Ball Straathof. </p><p>For more podcasts, visit <a href="http://www.solidgoldstudios.co.za/grounded.php">SolidGoldStudios.co.za/grounded</a></p>]]></description>

Ever ask how and why certain varieties make it to market and others don’t. The process of trialing is how. Plant trialing is not only an integral part of the green industry but it’s important for the consumer. Testing plants in varying parts of the country allows the breeders to make better decisions about what will look good and grow in the landscape and also allows the growers to decide what works best for their business and their cultural practices. We take a 'walk' through the process and highlight the upcoming plant trials at Ball Straathof.</itunes:summary>
