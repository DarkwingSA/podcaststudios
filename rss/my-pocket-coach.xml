<p>
In this episode, Gail Cameron (CEO and Founder of the Image Excellence Group), speaks to Linda Aiyer, about the hot topic of Leadership Coaching.

We begin by exploring what is leadership coaching and how we distinguish this from other forms of coaching. Central to this episode is a discussion on the changing landscape of work, and what is required of our leaders presently and going forward, to meet the demands of a VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world. In fact, when you add Disruption and Diversity to the mix, leaders are faced with an environment that is unrecognisable. Given this context, leadership coaching has become more critical and valued than ever.

Gail and Linda explore what a typical leadership coaching journey would look like, and discuss some of the tools that are utilised by coaches in this space. The tools discussed in this episode relate to the Leader Personality, what type of leader are you, and how does this impact the way you lead others. One of the other lenses we consider in customising a development path for each leader, is what stage of maturity they may be functioning at, and how to work with them to get to a level of optimum functioning and maximum impact.

If you are a leader, aspiring leader, or a leader without a title, then listen to this episode to gain insights as to how coaching can raise your level of effectiveness and impact.

Amanda speaks from experience as someone who embraced a major career change after a successful career as a journalist spanning 30 years. She shares the five-point strategy she has developed in order to produce empowering change and successful transitions.

In this episode Elri Wium, Executive Coach and Specialist on Nonverbal Communication, Emotion, and the Voice and Speech, speaks to Gail Cameron, the Director of the IE Group, about the important role that the voice and speech plays in the selling of ideas and your personal brand.  

In this information driven world, we tend to rely so much on our content, facts, material or data, that we tend forget about who we are presenting it to – the human. And that is where the body language, Emotional prosody, tone of voice, and modulation comes into play. This means that your content, facts, material or data might be brilliant, BUT if you cannot convey that information in an interesting way, whether in a boardroom, negotiation, presentation, interview, or even a team or staff meeting, then it will lose its effect completely and your ideas alone won’t get you anywhere. 

Therefore, in order to enhance your personal and communicative impact power in these high-stakes situations, it is imperative that you grasp the listeners attention and make yourself and the information memorable.

<p>
Perception is the only Reality others have; and their Perception is their Reality.


> Strategic Image Management and Personal Branding.

Our image management coaching focuses on Personal Branding and Image Excellence.

Personal branding is the inner perspective one needs to know about who you are, Image Excellence is the outward reflection and embodiment thereof. 

Authenticity is magnetic, if we can make the connection between the highest expression of our Personal Brand and what it would look like in the world, we start to develop a unique value proposition that is underpinned by a high degree of self-awareness and confidence. 

To guide us on this journey we use a framework that covers important elements outlining how we can enhance our personal impact power including:

- The Primacy Effect and its Criteria;
- “Enclothed” Cognition Psychology;
- Dress code for the work context;
- The Science of colour;
- Basic Body and Face shape Analysis; and
- Accessories, grooming, make up, hairstyle.



> What is Strategic Image Management?  
                      
Strategic Image Management by its very definition suggests that you can and should manage the perceptions that others have of you. Perception is the only reality. Strategic Image Management is a composite issue forming part of a holistic approach towards the way in which you communicate.

Everything about you speaks – your body language, appearance and your voice.
