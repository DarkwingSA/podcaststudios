Radio TMI - Where Leaders Talk

In the launch episode of Creating Culture, Elizabeth Viljoen interviews the man who inspired the podcast channel - Frank Tsuro, Immediate District Director of Toastmasters District 74 (Southern Africa). 

Frank lead the The Advanced Leadership Program for the Toastmasters Leadership Institute of Southern Africa. He challenged each participant to create a project that will inspire and support fellow Toastmasters. 

The podcast channel Radio TMI was the brainchild of Elizabeth Viljoen, but soon all twelve participants became inspired by the possibilities. With their teamwork this product was fine-tuned, and launched in February 2020.    

Thus far Radio TMI launched three programs:
* Coffee with Toastmasters by Wendy Khumalo of South Africa (Thursdays)
* Cappuccino Catch-ups and Meaningful Mochas by Teresa Huber of Zimbabwe (Mondays)
* Creating Culture by Elizabeth Viljoen of Namibia/New Zealand (Tuesdays)
Soon to launch:
* Let's Talk by Tebogo Majokana of South Africa
