The conversations start off with the new show by John Vlismas, called The End. A Comedy about Death.  They chat about behind the scenes of his father's recent death and how his family honored his amazing dad and gave him a beautiful send-off.  This very personal journey sparked curiosity for John and he created this hilariously funny show to honor his dad, but also give people some thought-provoking perspectives about life and death.

John Vlismas and Carmen Murray unpack everything from the observations how the human raced evolved, to how we love stories and why you should say what you think.  The need for acceptance.  The lessons learned and the beautiful triumph of the human spirit.

They then go further to talk about augmented leadership, AI, Tech, Innovation, PR, Sponsorship, epic brand failures and the future that will be designed for us by the new generation.

Sometimes, all you need is good company and a good laugh.

"Carmen Murray invited Founder Brian Altriche of RocoMamas and Mike Sharman, Founder of Retroviral to chat about the TV ad they launched that got the entire industry talking.  ""advertising lies"".  RocoMamas rejects any form of food styling and photoshopping and we get to dig deep into the brand and what makes this quirky brand one of the most loved restaurants in Africa.  The answer will definitely not disappoint.   Turns out Brian Altriche is the ""Jeff Bezos"" of South Africa and he takes us behind the scenes of this successful brand and their core values. Amazing!
 
What we loved about this interview is the chemistry between the client and the agency and how passionate they both are about the customer and the complete trust they have in each other.  True Customer Obsession.

As RocoMamas would say ""We’re not normal and simply couldn’t just make a normal TV ad. It had to be for those who expect more, who don’t fit in a box and believe what we believe."""

Carmen Murray chats with one of South Africa's renowned comedians, Barry Hilton.

They unpack everything from why he chose comedy as a vessel to express himself to all the lessons learned along the way.  One of the interesting discussions is all about the realization that every performance might not be a great one, but you grow to greatness by learning from each experience and to pick yourself up and have the courage to stand tall and show up.  So many of us face this in our lives, and it is comforting to learn from the best of the best in our country that this happens to us all.  

It is no secret that Johnny Noble and Barry Hilton had a special relationship and he saw potential in Barry and mentored him in his career.  He created opportunities to propel Barry's career forward.   

In this episode we talk about paying it forward, mentoring and creating opportunities for the next generation.  Surrounding yourself with the right mentors that uplift you.  We also touch on the role of a mentee when opportunities present itself.

Last but not least, Carmen Murray gets to play Barry Hilton's new game called Smart Ask where he is gifted the 'game time' of The Carmen Murray Show and get's to put her up for the challenge.

"Why is creativity a crucial competency for businesses and their employees? 
Can you Access Creativity?
How do you foster a culture of creativity?
How do you harness the creative energies of all business and stakeholders?

These are some of the pressing questions that Carmen Murray explores with the Creative Catalyst and Enablers Lana Leas-Roy, Taryn Marcus and Marc Hirschowitz to understand how we as creative beings lose our creativity as we are raised in society and how to claim it back to restore innovation within our organisations.


The combination of these creative energies, bring a fresh perspective to the need for critical creative skills and confidence to push a business forward into the modern age."

Carmen Murray, modern-day Feminist, and Mo Malele, a Performance Artist, Entrepreneur and a proud member of LGBT Community have a candid conversation with Diversity Inclusion Specialist and Coaches Ingrid Lotze and Gavin Moffat, co-founders of Hers and His. As Verna Myers famously said, "Diversity is being invited to the party, inclusion is being asked to dance"  In this episode, they highlight the problematic behavior conditioned by society, real-life scenario's, and cultural issues that stem from diversity and rears its ugly head in the workspace. The candid conversation covers everything from the inappropriate handshake to corrective rape, Equality vs Equity, Curiosity and Polarization. We also unpack the blueprint to Inclusion and how to improve the inclusive policy within your organisation and create a safe environment for everyone.

<p>
In this Episode Carmen Murray sits down with Linda Kachingwe-Sisya, Head of Marketing: Africa and Private Equity (RMB Ventures) and Dharshni Padayachee (Inclusion and equality at RMB) to discuss the Fearless Girl of Africa. RMB was inspired by the Wall Street's Fearless Girl and envisioned a life-sized and Afro-centric version of the artwork that would speak to the values of individuality, courage, and strength. The Original Fearless Girl from Wall Street, came with a lot of controversies, after discovering that the State Street Corporation, the firm that commissioned the popular "Fearless Girl" statue in New York's financial district was accused by the United States Labour Department of Payment Discrimination against female employees.
</p>

<p>
Carmen asks the hard questions. Why did RMB create the Africa Fearless Girl, and what message were they sending out to the world with the African Version. 
> Is their Backyard clean? 
> The Behind the Scenes of creating Africa's Fearless Girl? 
> Why a Girl and not a Woman?
> What is the message and do they live the message at RMB?

<p>
This is not going to be your typical episode. Get ready to learn and laugh for this one. Yes, Funny is a Serious Business, but who said you can't have fun and learn from the incredible Goliath Family. Collaboration has become a buzzword everyone uses, but for some reason, it is something very few businesses can master in business. The Goliath Brothers are disrupting the Comedy World and they are known for running an incredible business. Here is the catch, it's only Family. They say never go into business with family. So why can the Goliath Brothers make it work? What is the secret and what lessons can we learn from them? During the show, Donovan Goliath was doodling and we ended the show, with a challenge for all the listeners. #GoliathDoodle Challenge - Doodle the 3 brothers and tweet #GoliathDoodle and you can win one year access to the Goliath and Goliath Comedy Club for 2 people and get amazing T-Shirts.

This is not going to be your typical episode. Get ready to learn and laugh for this one. Yes, Funny is a Serious Business, but who said you can't have fun and learn from the incredible Goliath Family. Collaboration has become a buzzword everyone uses, but for some reason, it is something very few businesses can master in business. The Goliath Brothers are disrupting the Comedy World and they are known for running an incredible business. Here is the catch, it's only Family. They say never go into business with family. So why can the Goliath Brothers make it work? What is the secret and what lessons can we learn from them? During the show, Donovan Goliath was doodling and we ended the show, with a challenge for all the listeners. #GoliathDoodle Challenge - Doodle the 3 brothers and tweet #GoliathDoodle and you can win one year access to the Goliath and Goliath Comedy Club for 2 people and get amazing T-Shirts.

               <description><![CDATA[<p>
                  Carmen Murray is curious to see what happens in the world of "Kimberleigh Stark" and ambushed one of her auditions in pursuit to find new actors in South Africa. She wanted to have an understanding of what happens behind the scenes of Lights, Cameras, Action in preparation of the Future Fit Networking Events launch, powered by Boo-Yah! At the launch, the theme will be Storytelling and Kimberleigh will unpack storytelling secrets from the Hollywood Playground at this event, and Carmen wanted to see what the fuss was all about in order for her to share the "Behind The Scenes" of her day to day job. What she discovered was an eye-opener. Actors can't bring a bad story to life but give them a good story and you go on an emotional rollercoaster. Listen to this episode to learn more about #BehindTheScenes.

                  Carmen Murray sit down with the passionate, humorous, legendary and charasmatic Mark Keating, (CEO of Sales Guru, Top Sales Management Training and Keynote Speaker), to give the blue print for successful selling. He has built a phenomenal business focussed on one thing: to help South Africa's salespeople embrace professionalism and great selling practices to help businesses grow. In this episode Carmen and Mark unpacks the dreaded sales calls and the art of getting meetings and how to waste less time on unqualified leads. He teaches us the secrets of his "Boiler room" environment in London and gives us real world tips. Some people thrive by picking up the phone and calling a stranger to get a meeting and others absolutely hate it. Let's face it, cold calling is not for everyone. The only way your business will succeed is by doing sales the right way. When we try and get meetings do we hide behind emails? Is there a better way of writing an email and still yield results? Reaching out to someone on LinkedIn? What is the best way to cold call, be respectful, and land that meeting that could change your life? Mark Keating and Carmen Murray Role Plays some scenarios how to and unpack prospecting in detail to give the audiences an understanding of the right way and the wrong way of prospecting. This episode was so successful, that we decided to bring you a series of #SalesFit episodes to Future Fit your business by building a healthy pipeline, how to rebuttal, diagnose and set your business up for success.

               <title>How do you protect your ideas? | Marnus Broodryk, Shannon McLaughlin, Roy Taberer, Kimberleigh Stark</title>

               <itunes:subtitle>What SMEs can learn from Ubuntu Baba's clash with Woolworths</itunes:subtitle>

               <description>  <![CDATA[<p>
                    In this episode Carmen Murray interviews victims of corporate bullying (Shannon Mclaughlan - Ubuntu Baba) and (Kimberleigh Stark - Stark Raving SA). Carmen Murray invited Marnus Broodryk, (Shark Tank South Africa, SME Investor, KykNet's Winslyn Hustler) and patent attornty, Roy Taberer, to weigh in on idea stealing and how SMEs can protect the future of their businesses. What are their rights? Is the law for SMEs or against them? What lessons can we learn from this? There was an incident in South Africa, specifically around a small Business owner, Shannon McLaughlin of Ubuntu Baba, who had to stand up to the retail giant, Woolworths, after she discovered that her original design was copied and even sold under the same name. Many South Africans got behind this story and reprimanded Woolworths for their unethical practice. The reality is, it is not the first time - this happens every day. This is a very informative session discussing Product, Marketing and Advertising, Technology, Film and TV.
