Women's Month wrap-up — Digital Diaries Episode 4
Mbali Magudulela (Sibanye Stillwater) Nola Xala (Sibanye Stillwater) and Lindy Scott (Lindy Scott Creations)

This episode wraps up WiMSA's women's month programme. We reflect on the Digital Diaries programme which took place every Thursday in August (2020). Since WiMSA's 2020 drive is FutureFIT, where F stands for Focussed, I stands for Inspired and T stands for Transformed, we hosted four evening events with the same themes  (including Future).

The Digital Diaries series was sponsored by Sibanye Stillwater. WiMSA deputy chair (Petro du Pisani) speaks to Mbali and Nola from Sibanye Stillwater and Lindy Scott (fellow committee member and creative), who pulled together this amazing programme.

We talk about our highlights from the programme, supporting artists and creatives during the Covid-19 pandemic and how a focus on mental health provided the inspiration for putting the programme together.

Women in Mining Entrepreneurs- a found passion! — Inspired - conversation with a woman entrepreneur in mining - taking up space
Olebogeng Sentsho (Simba Mgodi Mining Incubation Fund | CEO)

In this Episode of Network, Lindi Nakedi has a candid conversation with Olebogeng Sentsho (Simba Mgodi Mining Incubation Fund CEO) on her passion for the mining industry and the responsibility that all women in mining have to ensure that more women can enter the space and thrive in it.

Olebogeng can be described as an unapologetically confident force, disrupting and challenging the status quo in mining. She is the voice of young women and men in the junior mining sector. 

Our conversation is on her journey into mining, legacy mindedness and challenges still faced by women in the industry and possible solutions.

This is the second installment of the WiMSA Digital Diaries in celebration of Women's Month and the theme for the week is INSPIRED.

Careers, Covid19 and Mining — What it takes to have a career in mining - an industry in transition
Claire McMaster (Fraser Alexander | Executive: Head Human Resources)

In this episode, Briony Liber, committee member and mentoring lead for Women in Mining South Africa, chats with Claire McMaster about what it takes to have a career in mining. 

The mining landscape and the skills required to thrive in a career in the mining industry have changed dramatically in the last few years, and Covid-19 has accelerated that. In this episode, we discuss the human resources challenges facing the mining industry, the way in which technology is contributing to and changing the mining industry, the changing skill sets that professionals need to survive and thrive in the mining industry, and how organisations can help their employees thrive under COVID-19 as it accelerates the need to embrace technological solutions.
