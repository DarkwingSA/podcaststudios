               <description><![CDATA[<p>
                  Carmen Murray is curious to see what happens in the world of "Kimberleigh Stark" and ambushed one of her auditions in pursuit to find new actors in South Africa. She wanted to have an understanding of what happens behind the scenes of Lights, Cameras, Action in preparation of the Future Fit Networking Events launch, powered by Boo-Yah! At the launch, the theme will be Storytelling and Kimberleigh will unpack storytelling secrets from the Hollywood Playground at this event, and Carmen wanted to see what the fuss was all about in order for her to share the "Behind The Scenes" of her day to day job. What she discovered was an eye-opener. Actors can't bring a bad story to life but give them a good story and you go on an emotional rollercoaster. Listen to this episode to learn more about #BehindTheScenes.

               <itunes:subtitle>The passionate, humorous, legendary and charasmatic Mark Keating, CEO of Sales Guru, shares his valuable blueprint for successful selling.</itunes:subtitle>

               <description><![CDATA[<p>
                  Carmen Murray sit down with the passionate, humorous, legendary and charasmatic Mark Keating, (CEO of Sales Guru, Top Sales Management Training and Keynote Speaker), to give the blue print for successful selling. He has built a phenomenal business focussed on one thing: to help South Africa's salespeople embrace professionalism and great selling practices to help businesses grow. In this episode Carmen and Mark unpacks the dreaded sales calls and the art of getting meetings and how to waste less time on unqualified leads. He teaches us the secrets of his "Boiler room" environment in London and gives us real world tips. Some people thrive by picking up the phone and calling a stranger to get a meeting and others absolutely hate it. Let's face it, cold calling is not for everyone. The only way your business will succeed is by doing sales the right way. When we try and get meetings do we hide behind emails? Is there a better way of writing an email and still yield results? Reaching out to someone on LinkedIn? What is the best way to cold call, be respectful, and land that meeting that could change your life? Mark Keating and Carmen Murray Role Plays some scenarios how to and unpack prospecting in detail to give the audiences an understanding of the right way and the wrong way of prospecting. This episode was so successful, that we decided to bring you a series of #SalesFit episodes to Future Fit your business by building a healthy pipeline, how to rebuttal, diagnose and set your business up for success.

               <itunes:subtitle>What SMEs can learn from Ubuntu Baba's clash with Woolworths</itunes:subtitle>

               <description>  <![CDATA[<p>
                    In this episode Carmen Murray interviews victims of corporate bullying (Shannon Mclaughlan - Ubuntu Baba) and (Kimberleigh Stark - Stark Raving SA). Carmen Murray invited Marnus Broodryk, (Shark Tank South Africa, SME Investor, KykNet's Winslyn Hustler) and patent attornty, Roy Taberer, to weigh in on idea stealing and how SMEs can protect the future of their businesses. What are their rights? Is the law for SMEs or against them? What lessons can we learn from this? There was an incident in South Africa, specifically around a small Business owner, Shannon McLaughlin of Ubuntu Baba, who had to stand up to the retail giant, Woolworths, after she discovered that her original design was copied and even sold under the same name. Many South Africans got behind this story and reprimanded Woolworths for their unethical practice. The reality is, it is not the first time - this happens every day. This is a very informative session discussing Product, Marketing and Advertising, Technology, Film and TV.
