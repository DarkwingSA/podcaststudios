Hey Limitless Fam. We love random chit chats and in this episode, we are just happy to have Lebo back in the pod with us. This is literally our first catch-up episode, all together! 

Carla gets deep into her thoughts about the reality show ""Real Housewives of Johannesburg""... maybe a little too deep. 

We discuss the rise of ""celebrity vulnerable confessions"", we are so torn, we are simply struggling to figure out if these are genuine expressions of vulnerability or just a publicity stunt for more album sales? 

We did warn you and it's in our tagline, sometimes, we are going to have fun, light and sometimes overly dumb conversations. This is our way of maintaining balance and having fun in between the growing and developing. 

The Limitless Podcast is very much an independent vehicle that runs on the support of our incredible listeners - that's you! So, if you’d like to support the show, we would like that very much. Hit ‘subscribe’ on Apple Podcasts or ‘follow’ on Spotify, and leave a review if you’re feeling especially generous. Then sit back and bask in our eternal, abundant love. Your hosts are Carla Fernandes (@carlaxiii), Dominique Reeby (@dominiqueiam) and Lebo Ndaba (@leboga)

Hey Limitless Fam. 

We are so amped to get this year into gear. We are dreaming BIG and manifesting beyond our wildest imaginations. Why not?! Give yourself permission to dream it real. 

Getting mentally and emotionally fit to tackle your dreams and wants is key. 
Maybe you are a vision board kind of person, or maybe goal lists better suit you. Whatever works for you do more of that. 

Do what you need to do to give you that edge and keep you motivated and inspired. 

In this episode, Dominique and Carla are in the pod, setting the tone for the podcast this year. We are bringing it on! Super cool guests: trailblazers, thought leaders and trend makers. 

We look forward to an amazing year with you.

In this episode delve into what should totally be a thing – 'African Girl Magic'.

What a magical year it has been for the continent, moreover for African women. 
South Africa's very own Zozibini Tunzi is the reigning Miss Universe. Bonang Matheba made it to the Breakfast Club and our gorgeous Guest star Sphum has released an EP - ""What Doesn't Kill You"". 

We discuss the EP as well as the intricacies of the South African music industry particularly the RnB scene for female artists.

<p>
Our very first episode and we get right into it!

We come with weeks' worth of baggage.

In this episode: We unpack a little about ourselves as well as a few trending topics of the week - #KFCProposal and how Twitter finally came together for the greater good.

The men behind the nation-building, how SA winning the Rugby World Cup resulted in uber-friendliness on the road. 

Dominique spills the beans on her adventures and the backlash received when shared with work-mates and Lebo reveals her 'dark' secret. 

Have we left you wanting to hear more?
Then hit 'SUBSCRIBE' now.
