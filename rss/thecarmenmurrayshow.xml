The Power of Purpose — Unforgettable account of one man's indomitable will to overcome adversity
Richard Wright | (Sales Guru, Successful Entrepreneur, Global Speaker, Author)

In this episode, get ready to be inspired as host, Carmen Murray chat to Richard Wright, author of 'The Power of Purpose'.

The Power of Purpose is an unforgettable account of one man’s indomitable will to overcome crippling adversity. Its power will remain with you long after you have turned the last page.

'The only thing in life that you have 100 per cent control over are the thoughts
in your head. When your thoughts are centred around the very essence of
your purpose, and the meaning of your life, you unleash immeasurable power.'  -  Richard Wright 

In 2016, Richard was confronted with a diagnosis of rare pituitary cancer - a disease about which little is known, other than that it is almost invariably terminal.

This is an interview of hope, resilience, authenticity and courage.

Anthropos – The 'Uber' of Health Care on the Rise — Detect meaningful changes through AI that allow carers and family to act
Paul Berney (Anthropos | CMO) and Founder of The Connected Marketer-

In this episode, get ready to be inspired as host, Carmen Murray chat to Paul Berney about the future of health care.

Paul Berney is the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) at Anthropos and Founder of The Connected Marketer-.

Anthropos is a connected care platform that enables remote monitoring of older people providing reassurance about their well-being using AI and sensors in a non-intrusive way.

By passively monitoring changes in patterns of behaviour of people, the platform can detect meaningful changes that allow carers and family members to know if their loved ones are well, if something is wrong or if something is changing over time. This knowledge can provide reassurance and allow carers to take preemptive action, helping keep older people in their own homes for longer.

Future | Strong opinions lightly held — Information flows in a conversation with a Futurist, an Artist and a Dean
Faith Popcorn (Futurist with accuracy of a sniper) Karen Zoid (Queen of Rock) Jon Foster-Pedley (Henley Business School | Dean)

In this episode:

Carmen Murray has an outrageous conversation with Faith Popcorn, Karen Zoid, and Jon Foster-Pedley that will be the gas in your tank.
 
Faith Popcorn, the world-renowned futurist and founder of BrainReserve (the Nostradamus of Marketing with the accuracy of a sniper) gives us a glimpse looking through the keyhole of the future and talks about what has changed for her during COVID-19 and how she is responding to this new world we now entered and what this means to us all.

She also reveals her wish to write a song with Karen Zoid.
 
Jon Foster-Pedley, Dean and Director of Henley Business School – Africa, guitarist, and the mastermind behind the 'Education Movement' allows the information to flow, and he shares such great insights about the new business world we have now embarked on through the art of storytelling.  
 
Karen Zoid, South African rock singer, songwriter, guitarist, composer, and talk show host states to the world where she is looking from and asks burning questions of Faith. Karen shares her take on collaboration, the rock stars of tomorrow, and who will bring the biggest change in the future. Karen Zoid is also the 'President' of The Republic of Zoid Africa, which started as a joke, because former South African president Jacob Zuma had a 'trillion ministers', and this launched a very successful TV Show. She ordains Faith, Jon, and Carmen as ministers of her cabinet and what it means to her, and a ground-breaking performance as she sings out the show with a song…

Carmen Murray, The original CyberPunk, (CEO of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services are better known as The Leonardo da Vincis of Marketing). She is also the representative of The Connected Marketer- in Africa, IAB Black Pixel Winner - Digital 2019, and nominated as one of the top women in tech- Africa-Meltwater and a storyteller by heart.

BONUS | Gory to Glory Story — Bring an open mind and grab a drink and come on a joyride of wisdom
Karen Zoid | Queen of Rock, Talk Show Host, The Voice SA Coach, Serial Entrepreneur

In this episode Karen Zoid - South African rock singer, songwriter, guitarist, composer, and talk show host. She has been dubbed South Africa's 'Queen of Rock' by several major local publications. Her followers and, more generally, the South African youth have also been referred to as the 'Zoid Generation' by the press. Karen is also known for hosting the kykNet television series Republiek van Zoid Afrika and is one of the Coaches on The Voice SA as well. 

In this episode, we had the most amazing interview with one of our favourite South African Artists.  Contrary to what Steve Hoffmeyer thinks, John Vlismas does not hate Afrikaans people and he definitely does not hate Afrikaans music.  Karen Zoid is 'F$@king' amazing.  

She joined us (Carmen Murray and John Vlismas) in the Solid Gold Virtual Podcast studio and told us her life story.  It's incredible.  We always knew we all have so much in common as Outsiders, just not how much.

Karen Zoid's dad 'Dr. Grief' got married 4 times so he has been pretty busy.  She went on to become quite a 'trouble' teenager and took quite a few drugs.  She got over all of that and then started to create South African punk music, anti-establishment, and an intellectual.  She's grown up to become one of the most popular musicians in South Africa.  Her last show, 5,000 people, before lock-down and a 43 piece orchestra.

She is incredible. Not only that but one of our favourite people to talk to on philosophical issues.  Unbelievable!  She told us how she wastes a lot of paper when she works.  She doodles like mad and she throws away more than she keeps.  Also, very important things to learn when you are creative.  

The other thing she likes to do is watch things unfold.
She doesn't like to plan.
She 'F$@king' hates lists.

She also spoke a great deal if you are an adventurer it is cool. an Adventurer that is comfortable with a spreadsheet ends up having a much better adventure.

Come and listen to Karen Zoid. She is 'F$@king' Amazing!

Carmen Murray (Award-winning digital expert and Founder of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services, Host of The Carmen Murray Show and the co-host of the In with the Two Outsiders Podcast and International Speaker) along with her co-host John Vlismas (Former stand up comedian, now a disruptive educator and Marketing Executive  at #HenleyAfrica and corporate trainer, serial entrepreneur, International Speaker)

Enjoy the episode!

She is incredible. Not only that but one of our favourite people to talk to on philosophical issues.  Unbelievable!  She told us how she wastes a lot of paper when she works.  She doodles like mad and she throws away more than she keeps.  Also, very important things to learn when you are creative.  

The other thing she likes to do is watch things unfold.
She doesn't like to plan.
She 'F$@king' hates lists.

She also spoke a great deal if you are an adventurer it is cool. an Adventurer that is comfortable with a spreadsheet ends up having a much better adventure.

Come and listen to Karen Zoid. She is 'F$@king' Amazing!

Carmen Murray (Award-winning digital expert and Founder of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services, Host of The Carmen Murray Show and the co-host of the In with the Two Outsiders Podcast and International Speaker) along with her co-host John Vlismas (Former stand up comedian, now a disruptive educator and Marketing Executive  at #HenleyAfrica and corporate trainer, serial entrepreneur, International Speaker)

Emotional DJ — Reinvent yourself and become a masterpiece of resilience — Smoke the hell out of your authentic self and let your re-invention begin
Arnaud Collery (French Actor, Comedian, Filmmaker, renowned TEDx Speaker, Happiness Coach and founder of Stand up for Passion)

Guest: Arnaud Collery French Actor, Entertainer, MC, Comedian, Filmmaker, Entrepreneur, and Innovator now finds himself playing an instrumental role as a Happiness coach, Emotional DJ, and Storyteller.  His focus is working on creativity and happiness related projects with companies and families and he created Stand Up for Passion aligned with his mission to make the world a more purpose-driven and meaningful place.  

In this episode:
Carmen Murray chats to Arnaud Collery about his renowned TedxTalk: ""Share your story before you die"" and the significance of storytelling and how people remember a story 22 times more than a fact. They talk about the reality of authenticity and how ""sanitised"" people and brands suffer the consequences of not leading an authentic life that leads to depression, anxiety, and addiction, to name a few.  They talk about the importance of boundaries, protecting your happiness, and how to embrace the unknown. 

They also address the elephant in the room, Covid-19.  This pandemic is not only infecting human beings but infecting societies and mindsets.  The mental trauma and fear faced by all those left behind. The truth of the matter is we have a backdrop of increasingly anxious, unhappy, and lonely people.  They look back at the Renaissance era, the black death, and what we can learn from this time to inspire people today and how you can be a masterpiece of resilience and reinvent yourself.  We also get a good dose of ""Arnaud Happiness"" injected in a light-hearted conversation between two strangers connecting from two different continents that will leave you inspired and excited about the new world waiting for us.

Emotional DJ — Reinvent yourself and become a masterpiece of resilience — Smoke the hell out of your authentic self and let your re-invention begin
Arnaud Collery (French Actor, Comedian, Filmmaker, renowned TEDx Speaker, Happiness Coach and founder of Stand up for Passion)

Guest: Arnaud Collery French Actor, Entertainer, MC, Comedian, Filmmaker, Entrepreneur, and Innovator now finds himself playing an instrumental role as a Happiness coach, Emotional DJ, and Storyteller.  His focus is working on creativity and happiness related projects with companies and families and he created Stand Up for Passion aligned with his mission to make the world a more purpose-driven and meaningful place.  

In this episode:
Carmen Murray chats to Arnaud Collery about his renowned TedxTalk: ""Share your story before you die"" and the significance of storytelling and how people remember a story 22 times more than a fact. They talk about the reality of authenticity and how ""sanitised"" people and brands suffer the consequences of not leading an authentic life that leads to depression, anxiety, and addiction, to name a few.  They talk about the importance of boundaries, protecting your happiness, and how to embrace the unknown. 

They also address the elephant in the room, Covid-19.  This pandemic is not only infecting human beings but infecting societies and mindsets.  The mental trauma and fear faced by all those left behind. The truth of the matter is we have a backdrop of increasingly anxious, unhappy, and lonely people.  They look back at the Renaissance era, the black death, and what we can learn from this time to inspire people today and how you can be a masterpiece of resilience and reinvent yourself.  We also get a good dose of ""Arnaud Happiness"" injected in a light-hearted conversation between two strangers connecting from two different continents that will leave you inspired and excited about the new world waiting for us.

<p>
In this episode Faith Popcorn (World-famous futurist, Founder of BrainReserve and the Nostradamus of Marketing) gives an exclusive backdrop to her life and the new horizon that awaits the human race.  

She chats to Carmen Murray (Award-winning digital expert and Founder of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services, Host of The Carmen Murray Show and the co-host of the In with the Two Outsiders Podcast and International Speaker) along with her co-host John Vlismas (Former stand up comedian, now disruptive educator at #HenleyAfrica and corporate trainer, serial entrepreneur, International Speaker)

This episode unfolds and takes an unexpected turn as we get to know the real Faith Popcorn, her journey to the top and secrets how you can predict the future and so much more.  

Here is a summary of what goes down in this episode:

Ms Popcorn is losing faith. 

Why? 

She’s reading the signs of the times and she says we are living in the age of narcissism.  Men are threatened by their own achievements - accelerating into a dangerous future. 

It's not all bad - Existential crisis of peacocks forcing reflection and fluidity so a sense of gender community may not be the key anymore - fluidity is. 

She insists to drive macro change by starting with a kid. “each takes one child” and openly shares the story behind the adoption of her children.  Faith mentions how her first daughter saved her from herself and gave her heart back.  Her side gig is one child at a time.  She says, ""They get it, they get love, they get kindness, they get care.""

Popcorn then gets into AI and how it is an extension of us - this is why we have to scrub ourselves and make sure AI is scrubbed too. Governments should insist on clear AI the way we aim for clean water and air.  

Seeing the future isn’t hard if you’re smart - it just takes thought. What you need to do is come back to the present and start looking for signs and signals to confirm. 

Faith jokes that she has abandonment issues, and like a pair of empathy bloodhounds, we sniff out her past, something she says she’s never been asked about and is really stumped by Carmen’s brilliant question.

A little girl ripped from her beloved Jewish New Yorker Bubba and Zeida and deposited in a catholic convent in Hong Kong by her CIA dad - we’re not surprised that she morphed into Faith Popcorn, and never stopped hunting the cause of her spy dad’s mysterious death.

In this episode Prof.Jonathan Jansen (Stellenbosch University | Professor in the Faculty of Education, known for his strong views on transformation, peaceful reconciliation and unity, and education activism) talks to co-hosts John Vlismas (Disruptive Educator, Entrepreneur, Public Speaker) and Carmen Murray (Entrepreneur, Marketing Maven, Public Speaker) about why he considers himself as an Outsider and shares an insight into his views, never heard before.

Here is a brief summary:

Imagine Yoda and our constitution had a baby.  I know, it’s messy, but it’s not.  This guest would be it.  He is amazing. He is a beautiful mix of irreverence and humility wrapped around a core of competence and commitment.  This Professor walks on the high wire between high academic towers and absolute street level.  He is incredible.  His XRay vision cuts through the smoke and mirrors.  Things like politics and prejudice.  He sees straight through it.  It’s unbelievable.  Imagine he had a """"light-saver"""", and when you press it, it just beams smiling and happiness, shoot out and make a blade that cuts through all that """"kak"""".  So he sees exactly what's facing our South African learners and he knows what's gotta be done.  He is blunt and sharp.  He is very passionate but very calm and he is very crazy but his considered.  He's an incredible, human being. He is an African Jedi master.  I don’t know how else to explain him to you.  Just feel like we sat at the feet of a Zen Master.

In this interview, he finally says if they call his name, he will step into the arena of politics and try and help this country.  He bluntly says, no matter what you say about education, there is no point having a 4th Industrial Revolution when children are worried about their own safety, hygiene and their level of hunger at school. He wants to fix that first.  The future is not about AI, its about ladies from NG Kerk becoming enlightened and teaching mathematics on the streets of Elsie’s River. That is the story of our Future.

All these things make our guests amazing. A brilliant mind with a massive heart and a devotion to a work called equity, we give you... Professor Jonathan Jansen.

<p>
In this episode, Dr. Beate Stiehler-Mulder, Prof. Mornay Roberts-Lombard and Mariette Frazer from the UJ Department of Marketing Management chats with host, Carmen Murray, co-founder of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services about Customer Experiences and the importance of understanding the Customer Experience Abyss.

Carmen Murray is caught off guard when her interview is hijacked by the UJ Department of Marketing Management and she is asked to offer her insights to the audience, interviewed by the high esteemed academics of the UJ Department of Marketing Management. 

They further unpack the difference between Customer Service and Customer Experience and the importance of Customer Experience Audits to understand the blind spots across each touchpoint of the business.  They further discuss how serving these touchpoints helps to grow, retain and acquire new customers.  

In this episode, scenarios are unpacked to highlight where brands fail their customers and how siloed Departments results in siloed customer experiences.  

This is a fun, yet very educational episode if you are seeking to take Customer Experiences seriously as part of your overall business strategy.

<p>
In this episode, the heavyweights of Marketing unpack the data conundrums of the 21st century.

Carmen Murray,(CEO of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services, Host, Speaker, Educator)  interviews the UJ Department of Marketing. She talks to:

Dr.Beate Stiehler-Mulder, (PhD in Marketing Management; Specialist in Marketing, Strategy and Branding);

Dr Ilse Struweg, (Professor in Marketing, specialising in strategic integrated communication, marketing); and

Dr.Melanie van Rooy (UJ Department of Marketing faculty member, Marketing and Operations Director at Meondo Financial Services).

This episode is packed with valuable insights and challenges that marketers face.  Marketers are expected in today's world to be unicorns.

As we move into the era of data obesity, there are many reasons why you should listen to this episode to inform tomorrow's problems, today.

Join the Outsider Movement : 

In this episode Stafford Masie (Worldclass Techtrepreneur, Serial Entrepreneur, Global Speaker, Husband, Father) talks to John Vlismas (Former Comedian, Faculty Member at Henley, Global Speaker, Disruptive Thinker, Educator, and serial entrepreneur) and co-host Carmen Murray (Host of Carmen Murray Show, Entrepreneur, Global Speaker, Educator, and Marketing Ninja). 

John and Carmen explore what makes Stafford Masie an Outsider and what does life look like from the outside looking in.  

Here is a brief summary: 
There is this Rabbi, he commits an atrocity or an act of passion, we will never know. It's in 1940's Johannesburg in a suburb. What happens then is a curious family tree grows with a zero-based history.  An apple grows from that tree, he falls from the tree, and he has a deep sense of loss at his core. Kind of a hollowness.  The apple rolls away to become the most accomplished South African in the tech space.  John and Carmen have this crazy open conversation with Stafford and he talks about the stuff he never really talks about. He draws a beautifully clear line from a hominid, Latin word for a big monkey in a cave, all the way through history to a young man doing cocaine in the toilet.  I know, it doesn't make any sense. But it will.  What happens then is, he illustrates how the muddy hand print in a cave echoes an eternity. All the way down to that young boy in the toilet and now his chances of being president are ruined by a memory captured digitally. So that is the Ape that created perfect memory, now fighting for the right, to enforce the right to forget.  Finally, he understands community, attribution, and legacy.  Those are the only 3 things we need to worry about. He also talks about how millennials have re-framed value.  Whatever you think is valuable, is wrong.  You don't have to own anything, you just need access to it. That's what's actually important. He then tells us that family is the ultimate social teacher.  Stafford Masie is a curious, analytical synthesizer,  fueled by a perceived cultural constraint.

He is a suburb example of an Outsider who has used negative drivers to realize massive value. 

We dare you! DON'T LISTEN TO THIS!

<p>
In this episode, Taz Singh, one of South Africa's top psychic Mediums with experience of over 20 years covering career, relationships, and health as well as a crossing over, sits down with host, Carmen Murray, to briefly chat about psychics and to understand how it all works.  
‪
Apparently, we are all psychic and Taz Singh gives us a little insight into her world.

Carmen Murray is exceptionally curious about this subject and with the rise of many psychics and clairvoyants, they experiment, by bringing in a surprise guest to allow for Taz to do a reading to demonstrate what this is all about.

Kimberleigh Stark waited in her car until she was instructed to come into the studio whilst Taz was interviewed by Carmen. Taz had no idea what her name was, and had no context or background. Kimberleigh Stark might be an actor, casting director but the things Taz picked up, no one could've known.

Listen in to this episode and discover the world of a psychic.

In this episode Vanda Harries, Business Coach and founder of The Life Architect who worked in the corporate world for over 30 years as a sought-after Marketing Director and Brand Builder chats to Carmen Murray, Founder of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services.  

Carmen decided to gift her audience with her own personal business coach, Vanda Harries to share the importance of having a business coach and the profound changes that happened for her after investing in herself, her brand and her business.  There is a perception that it's only for executives or for people who only start in their journeys, but in fact, there is a lot more to it than just coaching.  Whether you are an entrepreneur or developing your career, everyone should invest in a business coach to propel their careers forward and have more focus and clarity. 

Do you face difficult business decisions? 
Are you in conflict situations and not sure how to handle it?
Are you feeling stuck? 
Is your personal brand overshadowing your business brand?
Do you want to start building a personal brand?
Do you need someone to ask you the hard questions?
Are you seeking a business coach that can hold you accountable to your own goals?
Indecisive about what you want to do with your life?
Want to find your purpose?
Want to grow as a person and as a business?
You need someone to help you overcome your fears?


Vanda and Carmen also chat about personal branding and unpack why this journey is bespoke to each individual based on their personal goals, career or business goals.  Ultimately, every single person has a responsibility to build a personal brand for success and credibility. 

One of the hard questions they unpack, was how close can you get with your business coach in order for them to remain objective to best serve your needs?

In this episode, Matt Brown (High-Impact Entrepreneur, Host of the most loved podcast in Africa, The Matt Brown Show and Author of The Inner Game, downloaded over 1 million times on Amazon Prime) sits down with Carmen Murray, Entrepreneur, Award-Winning Digital Expert, Data Unicorn, and CX Warrior as they unpack the secret to his success.

Over 98% of businesses fail in their first 10 years. Of the 2% that survive, only a fraction of them will achieve high-impact growth.

Matt shares what makes a great business from their mediocre peers and the importance of grit and mindset.  In this episode, they discuss some of the secrets to success and principles that will define ultimate growth, in order for you to smash it.

Richard Mulholland refers to Matt Brown as Africa's answer to Tim Ferris.  

This is a candid conversation about the tumultuous journey of Entrepreneurship and why most people will not succeed.  Most people have inflated egos, feel entitled to success and end up sitting on the excuse bench rather than getting some skin in the game.

Matt announces the big journey that awaits and once again, he will put his money where his mouth is, and he will start all over again in a new continent.  

To learn more, we highly recommend you invest in the book 'Your Inner Game' by Matt Brown and gift it to an entrepreneur, youth, or someone who is considering to embark on this journey.  It is packed with valuable lessons to set you up for success.

In this episode award-winning, Anita Noyes-Smith (MD of Virgin Astrology) rated one of the top Medieval Astrologers in the world shares the rules of the stars with Carmen Murray, public figure, CEO of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services and IAB Black Pixel Winner for her best contribution to digital, Carmen Murray. 

Carmen Murray and Anita Noyes Smith managed after a year to bring this episode to life with their busy schedules.  

Anita Noyes-Smith has more than 30 years of study and experience in the field of Modern and Medieval Astrology.  She is a writer, motivational speaker, lecturer and consults to a base of more than 30,000 clients globally.

Anita unpacks the history of Medieval Astrology and how her teacher, Robert Zoller, considered the modern-day Nostradamus predicted the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York.

A very interesting part of the conversation is where Anita shares how world leaders, kings, and politicians have appointed astrologers as their private advisors for centuries.  Even today, we see so many celebrities, world leaders and institutions that appoint astrologists to give them direction.  They unpack how many businesses use Astrology.

Carmen and Anita decided to grab a glass of champagne as Anita prepares to give Carmen a snapshot of her birth chart.  It is one part of the 12 part consultation so not everything is uncovered, but what is shared in a few minutes was pretty interesting, especially because many of these things are not public knowledge.

In this episode, Joey Evans (Author of the incredible book Para to Dakar and highly sought-after global keynote speaker) sits down with the host of The Carmen Murray Show, 2019 IAB Black Pixel Winner for her best individual contribution to digital and CEO of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services.

In this episode, Carmen Murray sits at the edge of her seat as Joey Evans shares his story of overcoming paralysis and conquering the Dakar Rally.  It is a journey of courage and determination.

He starts by telling his story of his beautiful family and the amazing family he has and this exciting vision he had to do the Dakar Rally.  2007, a terrible accident happens during a race, and he and his family's lives changes.  He was paralysed from the chest down and bound to a wheelchair.  His dream to race the most grueling off-road race in the world, the 9000KM Dakar Rally was over.  

Joey Evans takes Carmen through the journey, the pain, the hope, the courage and they share a few deep moments as they reflect on his life, and what he achieved.  

It was a long and painful road to recovery, involving years of intensive rehabilitation and training, but he had the love and support of both family and friends and an incredible amount of determination.  

Joey shares many challenges he and his family faced, all the setbacks, the victories along the way to the Dakar Rally start line... In 2017, Joey becomes the only South African to finish the race.

This story will give you perspective, determination and hope to take on any hardship, any challenge that presents itself to you.

What a fun episode!  No geek talk.  Highly informative and a must for anyone who wants to do business in any country within Africa.  

In this episode, Mushambi Mutuma, Author of the incredible book, Tech Adjacent, speaker and tech leader with over 12 years of experience in Africa and the USA, and Founder of Altivex, speaks to host, Carmen Murray, Tech Enthusiast, CEO of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services, Customer Experience Queen and Marketing Wizzard about why Africa will leapfrog in the fourth industrial revolution.

Africa is a continent full of opportunities for investors, brands, entrepreneurs and technology enablers.  If you can innovate in Africa, you can innovate anywhere in the world.  There is a unique recipe to success and it can not happen in isolation from its people which we discuss in detail. We are leading in banking, and have innovated so many technologies to solve African problems that are now being adopted globally.  We unpack this in more detail.

In this episode, we unpack the exponential guide to leveraging technology for business success.  Innovating in Africa is not just about shiny technology, but leveraging the technology that works, keep it simple and eradicate problems by making the lives easier for the customers.  

Artificial Intelligence, Automation, Blockchain, Big Data, Internet of Things, The Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Who actually knows what any of these concepts mean for their business, much less how to integrate them?  Things are moving at a faster pace than ever before and trying to keep up has become intimidating and overwhelming. It's tempting to bury your head in the sand than try to make head or tail of it all.

Know one thing for sure. None of these buzzwords matter!  You don't have to jump aboard every single change and adjustment in the market or trade-in your suit for a T-shirt, jeans and sneaker combo.  If you have the right context, it is a lot simpler to understand and use technological shifts as an opportunity to transform your business.

In this episode Cindy Gallop (Top 100 AdAge Women; Founder IfWeRanTheWorld; Founder MakeLoveNotPorn; Bartle Bogle Hegarty Wizz and recently interviewed by Gary Vaynerchuck at Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity) talks to Carmen Murray #FearlessWomenActivist, CEO of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services about Sex, Lies and beating this shit system.

Bad is Good.  Good is Bad. 

If you speak up, you are bad.
If you are not politically correct, you are bad.
If you question things, you are bad.
If you stand up for yourself, you are bad.

BUT....you are good if you shut up. Know your place. Do your job. Play politics. Be Silent.  

Well, today this is a ""bad-ass"" episode because we are not going to sit in silence and we will call a spade a spade.

Cindy Gallop shares with us the challenges linked to the legacy system that is not built for Women to lean in.  

Inspired by the women sharing their #MeToo stories of sexual assault and harassment in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, Cindy Gallop has issued a call for women in advertising to come forward with their own stories—and to name the names of their harassers. She shares with us the appalling discoveries by some of the most powerful men in advertising.

As an activist for change, Cindy does not have time to beat around the bush and gets straight into the ugly things happening and her advice to eradicate this problem.

We further discuss MakeLoveNotPorn and the importance of real sex happening between loving couples should be shared.  This way we can see what consent looks like and how this movement can eradicate the rape culture.  The Future of Sex. 

We all do it, we just don't talk about it.

In this episode Cindy Gallop (Top 100 AdAge Women; Founder IfWeRanTheWorld; Founder MakeLoveNotPorn; Bartle Bogle Hegarty Wizz and recently interviewed by Gary Vaynerchuck at Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity) talks to Carmen Murray #FearlessWomenActivist, CEO of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services about Sex, Lies and beating this shit system.

Bad is Good.  Good is Bad. 

If you speak up, you are bad.
If you are not politically correct, you are bad.
If you question things, you are bad.
If you stand up for yourself, you are bad.

BUT....you are good if you shut up. Know your place. Do your job. Play politics. Be Silent.  

Well, today this is a ""bad-ass"" episode because we are not going to sit in silence and we will call a spade a spade.

Cindy Gallop shares with us the challenges linked to the legacy system that is not built for Women to lean in.  

Inspired by the women sharing their #MeToo stories of sexual assault and harassment in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, Cindy Gallop has issued a call for women in advertising to come forward with their own stories—and to name the names of their harassers. She shares with us the appalling discoveries by some of the most powerful men in advertising.

As an activist for change, Cindy does not have time to beat around the bush and gets straight into the ugly things happening and her advice to eradicate this problem.

We further discuss MakeLoveNotPorn and the importance of real sex happening between loving couples should be shared.  This way we can see what consent looks like and how this movement can eradicate the rape culture.  The Future of Sex. 

We all do it, we just don't talk about it.

In this episode, Rebone Masemola (Founder of the Woke Project) talks to host Carmen Murray, CEO of Boo Yah Modern Marketing Services about wokeness and the forms and shapes its taking in society and why we as individuals and businesses should pay attention to this global movement that is shaping the behaviour of people in this modern age.

They explore the topic of anthropology and Rebone shares various insights about the woke era and the fact that being uncomfortable is a good thing.  Being woke also sets the tone of creativity and how we tell stories.

They touch on the topic of the Oppression Olympics.  Being woke comes with its challenges because it lacks action which is a conversation Carmen and Rebone explores further in their conversation.

More background about Rebone Masemola:

WokeProject was founded by Rebone Masemola, a TEDx Speaker, Feminist Blogger and Thought Leader with an MA in Anthropology from Johannesburg. She was featured as a ‘Young Leader To Watch’ by Fast Company in 2019, nominated as a Top 100 Disruptor for 2018 and Top 8 Wonder under 30 To Watch.

She created the platform because there is a gap when it comes to diverse representations of the stories of minority groups. She felt that the mainstream media doesn’t truly report on narratives and the lived realities of Women of color, Youth and LGBTQI communities in a way that reflects and resonates with their daily lives.

Philippa Dods; Marketing at Meltwater, Director at Future Females, WEF Global Shaper speaks to Carmen Murray, CEO of Boo Yah, and host of The Carmen Murray Show about her journey to prepare for the Ironman Race and how she managed to raise R50 000 for the Rape Fund Crisis.

Preparing for the Ironman is definitely not an easy task and it truly takes resilience and grit to make it happen.  A young woman inspiring change and in South Africa to stand up for what they believe in and to make a difference no matter their age.  She is a force of nature. She is in the front lines fighting for women, their careers and one of the wonders that will bring a tsunami of change in the future of South Africa. Go, Girl!

She shares with us some of her lessons and what it takes to prepare for a race like this and unpacks crowdfunding and how she managed to raise these funds in a short amount of time.

Philippa Dods is a true example of what it takes to have a purpose and go against all odds to make it happen.  Cause brings effect when you put your mind to it.

What a way to kick off our #WomenofSteel series on the Matt Brown Show. She’s back again with the enthusiasm and energy we love to experience, fellow Podcast Host, Innovator, Strategist and fearless Women’s Rights Activist, Carmen Murray is my guest for the second time and as a tribute to women’s month we’ll be digging into the topic of women empowerment. It’s time for a refreshing and empowering perspective and as a true Woman of Steel, that is something Carmen has in abundance, we get to chatting about what she has been up to lately, her new upcoming book, thought leadership and of course fearless woman, the need for equal representation and pay of women in the workplace and putting your money where your mouth is when it comes to standing up for what you believe in. We are in a new age and slowly but surely people are waking up to realise the injustices that have been instilled in our society and everyday lives, at work, in the media and practically everywhere we look. Don’t stand by and watch, educate yourself and stick your hand up to strive for a cause that you believe in. For a refreshing and inspiring podcast experience listen into this #womenofsteel episode with the outstanding equality warrior that is Carmen Murray.

In this episode eNCA journalists Michelle Craig, with almost 13 years experience in the broadcast industry,Mmanaledi Mataboge-Mashetla, former Mail & Guardian's political editor and now eNCA's senior researcher, together with Helene Nieuwenhuis, a seasoned broadcast producer, currently eNCA's Special Project Producer joins Carmen Murray to discuss the stories of the apartheid struggle of the women and families of the Cradock 4, and the stories that happened behind the camera filming the documentary series: Women of the Liberation.

The role of female journalists in bringing female stories to life:

It requires a certain level of sensitivity, and 'soft skills' to gain people's trust and to allow them to open up to you.  Also, they literally shot the series in people's homes, in their personal space and had to dig through their family archives.

The thinking behind featuring specifically the women of the liberation movement.

Background about the stories that lived behind the camera.  These are PEOPLE, not just a story - in fast moving media cycle we often seem to forget this...

People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it?  Are you selling the drill or the hole in the wall?  

One of the biggest challenges we all face whether you work for a multinational or you are an entrepreneur is telling people what you do with conviction in as little time as possible.

Learn from the best and take the learnings and apply it in your own life to set you up for success.

John Vlismas and Carmen Murray unpack everything from the observations how the human raced evolved, to how we love stories and why you should say what you think.  The need for acceptance.  The lessons learned and the beautiful triumph of the human spirit.

They then go further to talk about augmented leadership, AI, Tech, Innovation, PR, Sponsorship, epic brand failures and the future that will be designed for us by the new generation.

Get yourself a cup of coffee and a pen and paper handy, as this candid conversation will give you a lot to think about, and share lessons, failures, regrets, authenticity and ""wokeness"" to empower you to think differently about the challenges you might face tomorrow.  Sometimes, all you need is good company and a good laugh.

"Carmen Murray invited Founder Brian Altriche of RocoMamas and Mike Sharman, Founder of Retroviral to chat about the TV ad they launched that got the entire industry talking.  ""advertising lies"".  RocoMamas rejects any form of food styling and photoshopping and we get to dig deep into the brand and what makes this quirky brand one of the most loved restaurants in Africa.  The answer will definitely not disappoint.   Turns out Brian Altriche is the ""Jeff Bezos"" of South Africa and he takes us behind the scenes of this successful brand and their core values. Amazing!
 
What we loved about this interview is the chemistry between the client and the agency and how passionate they both are about the customer and the complete trust they have in each other.  True Customer Obsession.

As RocoMamas would say ""We’re not normal and simply couldn’t just make a normal TV ad. It had to be for those who expect more, who don’t fit in a box and believe what we believe."""

Carmen Murray chats with one of South Africa's renowned comedians, Barry Hilton.

They unpack everything from why he chose comedy as a vessel to express himself to all the lessons learned along the way.  One of the interesting discussions is all about the realization that every performance might not be a great one, but you grow to greatness by learning from each experience and to pick yourself up and have the courage to stand tall and show up.  So many of us face this in our lives, and it is comforting to learn from the best of the best in our country that this happens to us all.  

It is no secret that Johnny Noble and Barry Hilton had a special relationship and he saw potential in Barry and mentored him in his career.  He created opportunities to propel Barry's career forward.   

In this episode we talk about paying it forward, mentoring and creating opportunities for the next generation.  Surrounding yourself with the right mentors that uplift you.  We also touch on the role of a mentee when opportunities present itself.

Last but not least, Carmen Murray gets to play Barry Hilton's new game called Smart Ask where he is gifted the 'game time' of The Carmen Murray Show and get's to put her up for the challenge.

"Why is creativity a crucial competency for businesses and their employees? 
Can you Access Creativity?
How do you foster a culture of creativity?
How do you harness the creative energies of all business and stakeholders?

These are some of the pressing questions that Carmen Murray explores with the Creative Catalyst and Enablers Lana Leas-Roy, Taryn Marcus and Marc Hirschowitz to understand how we as creative beings lose our creativity as we are raised in society and how to claim it back to restore innovation within our organisations.


The combination of these creative energies, bring a fresh perspective to the need for critical creative skills and confidence to push a business forward into the modern age."

Carmen Murray, modern-day Feminist, and Mo Malele, a Performance Artist, Entrepreneur and a proud member of LGBT Community have a candid conversation with Diversity Inclusion Specialist and Coaches Ingrid Lotze and Gavin Moffat, co-founders of Hers and His. As Verna Myers famously said, "Diversity is being invited to the party, inclusion is being asked to dance"  In this episode, they highlight the problematic behavior conditioned by society, real-life scenario's, and cultural issues that stem from diversity and rears its ugly head in the workspace. The candid conversation covers everything from the inappropriate handshake to corrective rape, Equality vs Equity, Curiosity and Polarization. We also unpack the blueprint to Inclusion and how to improve the inclusive policy within your organisation and create a safe environment for everyone.

</p>

<p>
In this Episode Carmen Murray sits down with Linda Kachingwe-Sisya, Head of Marketing: Africa and Private Equity (RMB Ventures) and Dharshni Padayachee (Inclusion and equality at RMB) to discuss the Fearless Girl of Africa. RMB was inspired by the Wall Street's Fearless Girl and envisioned a life-sized and Afro-centric version of the artwork that would speak to the values of individuality, courage, and strength. The Original Fearless Girl from Wall Street, came with a lot of controversies, after discovering that the State Street Corporation, the firm that commissioned the popular "Fearless Girl" statue in New York's financial district was accused by the United States Labour Department of Payment Discrimination against female employees.
</p>

<p>
Carmen asks the hard questions. Why did RMB create the Africa Fearless Girl, and what message were they sending out to the world with the African Version. 
> Is their Backyard clean? 
> The Behind the Scenes of creating Africa's Fearless Girl? 
> Why a Girl and not a Woman?
> What is the message and do they live the message at RMB?

This is not going to be your typical episode. Get ready to learn and laugh for this one. Yes, Funny is a Serious Business, but who said you can't have fun and learn from the incredible Goliath Family. Collaboration has become a buzzword everyone uses, but for some reason, it is something very few businesses can master in business. The Goliath Brothers are disrupting the Comedy World and they are known for running an incredible business. Here is the catch, it's only Family. They say never go into business with family. So why can the Goliath Brothers make it work? What is the secret and what lessons can we learn from them? During the show, Donovan Goliath was doodling and we ended the show, with a challenge for all the listeners. #GoliathDoodle Challenge - Doodle the 3 brothers and tweet #GoliathDoodle and you can win one year access to the Goliath and Goliath Comedy Club for 2 people and get amazing T-Shirts.

The Goliath Brothers are disrupting the Comedy World and they are known for running an incredible business. Here is the catch, it's only Family. They say never go into business with family. So why can the Goliath Brothers make it work? What is the secret and what lessons can we learn from them? During the show, Donovan Goliath was doodling and we ended the show, with a challenge for all the listeners. #GoliathDoodle Challenge - Doodle the 3 brothers and tweet #GoliathDoodle and you can win one year access to the Goliath and Goliath Comedy Club for 2 people and get amazing T-Shirts.

               <description><![CDATA[<p>
                  Carmen Murray is curious to see what happens in the world of "Kimberleigh Stark" and ambushed one of her auditions in pursuit to find new actors in South Africa. She wanted to have an understanding of what happens behind the scenes of Lights, Cameras, Action in preparation of the Future Fit Networking Events launch, powered by Boo-Yah! At the launch, the theme will be Storytelling and Kimberleigh will unpack storytelling secrets from the Hollywood Playground at this event, and Carmen wanted to see what the fuss was all about in order for her to share the "Behind The Scenes" of her day to day job. What she discovered was an eye-opener. Actors can't bring a bad story to life but give them a good story and you go on an emotional rollercoaster. Listen to this episode to learn more about #BehindTheScenes.

               <description><![CDATA[<p>
                  Carmen Murray sit down with the passionate, humorous, legendary and charasmatic Mark Keating, (CEO of Sales Guru, Top Sales Management Training and Keynote Speaker), to give the blue print for successful selling. He has built a phenomenal business focussed on one thing: to help South Africa's salespeople embrace professionalism and great selling practices to help businesses grow. In this episode Carmen and Mark unpacks the dreaded sales calls and the art of getting meetings and how to waste less time on unqualified leads. He teaches us the secrets of his "Boiler room" environment in London and gives us real world tips. Some people thrive by picking up the phone and calling a stranger to get a meeting and others absolutely hate it. Let's face it, cold calling is not for everyone. The only way your business will succeed is by doing sales the right way. When we try and get meetings do we hide behind emails? Is there a better way of writing an email and still yield results? Reaching out to someone on LinkedIn? What is the best way to cold call, be respectful, and land that meeting that could change your life? Mark Keating and Carmen Murray Role Plays some scenarios how to and unpack prospecting in detail to give the audiences an understanding of the right way and the wrong way of prospecting. This episode was so successful, that we decided to bring you a series of #SalesFit episodes to Future Fit your business by building a healthy pipeline, how to rebuttal, diagnose and set your business up for success.

               <title>How do you protect your ideas? | Marnus Broodryk, Shannon McLaughlin, Roy Taberer, Kimberleigh Stark</title>

               <itunes:subtitle>What SMEs can learn from Ubuntu Baba's clash with Woolworths</itunes:subtitle>

               <description>  <![CDATA[<p>
                    In this episode Carmen Murray interviews victims of corporate bullying (Shannon Mclaughlan - Ubuntu Baba) and (Kimberleigh Stark - Stark Raving SA). Carmen Murray invited Marnus Broodryk, (Shark Tank South Africa, SME Investor, KykNet's Winslyn Hustler) and patent attornty, Roy Taberer, to weigh in on idea stealing and how SMEs can protect the future of their businesses. What are their rights? Is the law for SMEs or against them? What lessons can we learn from this? There was an incident in South Africa, specifically around a small Business owner, Shannon McLaughlin of Ubuntu Baba, who had to stand up to the retail giant, Woolworths, after she discovered that her original design was copied and even sold under the same name. Many South Africans got behind this story and reprimanded Woolworths for their unethical practice. The reality is, it is not the first time - this happens every day. This is a very informative session discussing Product, Marketing and Advertising, Technology, Film and TV.
