Radio TI | Where Leaders Talk

Nikki Quinn, current Toastmasters International District 74 Director, is interviewed by Elizabeth Viljoen on Radio TI's podcast program 'Creating Culture.'

Our Southern African District Director answers important questions about the annual Council Meeting and International Prepared Speaking Contest - the highlight of the local Toastmasters's year. Due to measures implemented to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the important meeting and contest will be held online. 

What is the vision if the District Council meeting? Why can't the meeting be postponed? What District business must be conducted? Who will attend? May I as a regular member attend? 

And most importantly: Will the meeting be fun?

In this ninth episode of 'Cappuccino Catch-ups and Meaningful Mochas' Teresa Huber of Radio TMI (Radio Toastmasters International, District 74) interviews Dorothy Chanakira (DTM, Coach and Executive Toastmasters Past President). 

Dorothy believes that success is the progressive realisation of a worthy ideal. She shares her experience with teens and believes that leadership is not only taught but also demonstrated by leading through example. Dorothy encourages people to live in the present as most people speak on the past or future and forget to live in the moment. 

Coach Dorothy says that due to the current situation there is no better time then now to self reflect, re-strategize and reconnect with self and others in the true sense of the word.

Radio TI | Where leaders talk

Elizabeth Viljoen of Creating Culture interviews Erich Viedge, who has been a Toastmaster for many years and has been the Toastmasters International District 74 Director for 2011/12. 

He is a business improvement coach, an international speaker, and a consultant focusing on business improvement, leadership, innovation, team effectiveness and motivation.

Erich is also a polyglot. The difference between a polyglot and a multilingual person is that a polyglot loves languages for their own sake, while a multilingual person learned languages due to external factors. 
 
How has Toastmasters influenced his career? Who are his mentors? How do we inspire through speaking? How will digital media such as podcasting and online meetings shape our culture?

Radio TI | Where Leaders Talk. In this 8th episode of Coffee With Toastmasters, Wendy Khumalo talks to Carole Grech-Cumbo, the founder of Thrive, about Stress and it’s management. 

Carole Grech-Cumbo started her career in a children's home where she was entrusted with the psychological and emotional wellbeing of nearly 100 children between the ages of 3 and 18. This ignited her lifelong passion for working with young children and teenagers.
 
Despite being a full-time mom and entrepreneur, Carole always endeavoured to find ways to better deal with the human condition by studying hundreds of books and immersing herself in numerous courses over the years.

All of Carole’s knowledge and experience has now culminated in Thrive’s powerful courses. Each of these is based on the curation of the most effective and powerful strategies she has studied that enable the transformation from struggle to flourish in this challenging day and age.

In this episode, where she shares her knowledge on stress and it’s management she talks about her organization, Thrive, her journey in Toastmasters International and elaborates her definition of Stress. 

As her mission at Thrive is to help children and adults deal with stress, she also discusses stressors in both children and adults and how to notice stress in children, how to help them manage it as well as ways to deal with stress in this time of a global pandemic.

In this episode of Coffee With Toastmasters, Wendy Khumalo chats to Adam Hoffman about the importance of proper posture, body functional movement, nutrition as well as the transferable skills from Toastmasters International to business. 

Adam Hoffman is the owner and head coach of his growing Fitness Company, Hoffman’s Fitness (HF). He is a Certified Personal Trainer, Nutritionist, and Golf Specialist through N.A.S.M. (National Academy of Sports Medicine), a Crossfit Level-1 Trainer, TRX Qualified and a proud Toastmaster member.

Adam’s practice in the fitness industry has one enduring goal, and that is to safely provide proper exercise and nutrition guidance for each client.

“When training your body in the areas of muscle building, weight control, endurance boost and mobility increase through exercise and nutrition, you also gain the ability to maintain and improve health all while helping to prevent, mitigate, and potentially cure a variety of bodily pains and diseases.” Says Adam.

The exercise focus at HF is on total body functional movement. Most of these functional movements mimic how humans move on a daily basis, including: squats, deadlifts, chest press, shoulder press, and many more multi-joint and single joint exercises. Think about picking things off of the ground or lifting things above your head, even getting out of your car. 

Hoffman’s Fitness teaches how to perform these tasks properly for strength, everyday life, and overall health.

Their nutrition focus is on whole foods that are minimally processed with a minimal amount of ingredients. 

If you’re battling with making a decision between working out, exercising or having better eating patterns or the overall benefits of these remedies, you definitely will want to listen in till the end as Adam gives his professional advice on nutrition and fitness.

In this sixth episode of 'Cappuccino Catch-ups and Meaningful Mochas' Teresa Huber of Radio TMI (Radio Toastmasters International, District 74) interviews Tinashe Kingsley Mariga. 

As the uncle of a nephew who lost his parents at a young age, he stepped into the role of parenting. During this interview he talks about his role as a single dad and shares tips such as how to attentively listen to teenagers and how to help them with problem solving. 

Toastmasters helped to form him into the person he is today - and through Toastmasters he practiced exactly those skills he needed to become such a good parent. Leadership and listening skills are some of the transferable skills we need in everyday situations like parenthood.

Radio TMI | Where Leaders Talk

In this fourth episode, Teresa Huber of Radio TMI (Radio Toastmasters International, District 74) interviews fellow single mothers Claudia Da Silva and Vongai Tugwete about the challenges of raising teenagers in a world controlled by social media. 

They discuss peer pressure, building a community of friends, and how their teenagers became or are becoming well-adapted adults. 

Since their children have attended the Toastmasters Youth Leadership Program at school in Zimbabwe, they can compare notes on the advantages of honing speaking and leadership skills.

Radio TMI | Where Leaders Talk

In this fourth episode, Teresa Huber of Radio TMI (Radio Toastmasters International, District 74) interviews fellow single mothers Claudia Da Silva and Vongai Tugwete about the challenges of raising teenagers in a world controlled by social media. 

They discuss peer pressure, building a community of friends, and how their teenagers became or are becoming well-adapted adults. 

Since their children have attended the Toastmasters Youth Leadership Program at school in Zimbabwe, they can compare notes on the advantages of honing speaking and leadership skills.

In the third episode of Cappuccino Catch-ups and Meaningful Mochas, Teresa Huber of Zimbabwe interviews Hamilton Katsvairo. He uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and other frameworks to understand teenagers, as well as the opportunities and challenges they are facing. 

For children, he says, the purpose of your life is a life of purpose.
1. Your purpose is to identify your talent or gift
2. Through education at home and school you develop your talent and gift
3. Your mission in life is to give your talent and gift through your service to your family, your community and your country.

Being a parent himself, he discovered that children measure our love in the amount of time we spend with them."

Radio TMI – Where leaders talk.

In this episode of Coffee With Toastmasters by Wendy Khumalo, Emma El-Karout, a former HR Director and founder of One Circle, talks about One Circle, hard career choices, career changes and unemployment solutions. She also gives her word of advice to job seekers and professionals seeking change and new purpose. 

Emma El-Karout is a Johannesburg-based future work innovator who founded One Circle, an online platform connecting businesses with freelance HR experts, from around the world and on-demand.

As an HR Director she worked with some great individual talent, but always found specialist gaps in the corporate HR teams she led, which she had to plug with expensive consultant resources provided by big brands. Expecting smores and double chocolate chips for these fees, she normally got vanilla.

Emma knew there had to be a better way for her to access the specialist HR expertise she needed, at real market prices. As an ex-consultant herself, she knew as well that there’s no shortage of specialised talent globally. A way to bring those project opportunities closer to where the people are would be a winning formula. 

Combined with her belief that the new workforce would be based on an on-demand model, when people would decide when, where and for how much they worked, she created One Circle to enable direct relationships between HR professionals and the corporate leaders in need of their skills by leveraging technology and cutting out the middleman.

Emma aspires to combat few of the major societal issues in South Africa, being unemployment, gender and age bias, and the retention of experienced workers in the economy post-retirement.

Radio TMI - Where Leaders Talk

In the launch episode of Creating Culture, Elizabeth Viljoen interviews the man who inspired the podcast channel - Frank Tsuro, Immediate District Director of Toastmasters District 74 (Southern Africa). 

Frank lead the The Advanced Leadership Program for the Toastmasters Leadership Institute of Southern Africa. He challenged each participant to create a project that will inspire and support fellow Toastmasters. 

The podcast channel Radio TMI was the brainchild of Elizabeth Viljoen, but soon all twelve participants became inspired by the possibilities. With their teamwork this product was fine-tuned, and launched in February 2020.    

Thus far Radio TMI launched three programs:
* Coffee with Toastmasters by Wendy Khumalo of South Africa (Thursdays)
* Cappuccino Catch-ups and Meaningful Mochas by Teresa Huber of Zimbabwe (Mondays)
* Creating Culture by Elizabeth Viljoen of Namibia/New Zealand (Tuesdays)
Soon to launch:
* Let's Talk by Tebogo Majokana of South Africa
