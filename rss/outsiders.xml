<p>John Vlismas and Carmen Murray unite as two formidable forces and visionary thinkers to unlock your inner Øutsider. It's time to get off the couch into the arena, disrupt your thinking and get real in this chaotic world. Be the catalyst for change and question everything.</p>	
<p>The one thing that makes Outsiders powerful, is the ability to turn their back to the crowds and face the music they want to create. The IN with the TWO Outsiders podcast is about two underdogs, John Vlismas and Carmen Murray who find other underdogs, misfits, professional trouble makers, activists, and uncover their underdog story looking from the outside in. They have meaningful conversations with people that are changing the way we see the world, one word, one day, one act at a time.</p>	
<p>If you are an Underdog, then you are an Outsider. If you are a rebel, then you are an Outsider. If you are a trouble maker, you are an Outsider. If you want to expand your mind, you are an Outsider. If you are awakened, you are an Outsider.</p>

Gory to Glory Story — Bring an open mind and grab a drink and come on a joyride of wisdom
Karen Zoid | Queen of Rock, Talk Show Host, The Voice SA Coach, Serial Entrepreneur

In this episode Karen Zoid - South African rock singer, songwriter, guitarist, composer, and talk show host. She has been dubbed South Africa's 'Queen of Rock'"" by several major local publications. Her followers and, more generally, the South African youth have also been referred to as the 'Zoid Generation' by the press. Karen is also known for hosting the kykNet television series Republiek van Zoid Afrika and is one of the Coaches on The Voice SA as well. 

In this episode, we had the most amazing interview with one of our favourite South African Artists.  Contrary to what Steve Hoffmeyer thinks, John Vlismas does not hate Afrikaans people and he definitely does not hate Afrikaans music.  Karen Zoid is 'F$@king' amazing.  

She joined us (Carmen Murray and John Vlismas) in the Solid Gold Virtual Podcast studio and told us her life story.  It's incredible.  We always knew we all have so much in common as Outsiders, just not how much.

Karen Zoid's dad 'Dr. Grief' got married 4 times so he has been pretty busy.  She went on to become quite a 'trouble' teenager and took quite a few drugs.  She got over all of that and then started to create South African punk music, anti-establishment, and an intellectual.  She's grown up to become one of the most popular musicians in South Africa.  Her last show, 5,000 people, before lock-down and a 43 piece orchestra.

She is incredible. Not only that but one of our favourite people to talk to on philosophical issues.  Unbelievable!  She told us how she wastes a lot of paper when she works.  She doodles like mad and she throws away more than she keeps.  Also, very important things to learn when you are creative.  

The other thing she likes to do is watch things unfold.
She doesn't like to plan.
She 'F$@king' hates lists.

She also spoke a great deal if you are an adventurer it is cool. an Adventurer that is comfortable with a spreadsheet ends up having a much better adventure.

Come and listen to Karen Zoid. She is 'F$@king' Amazing!

Carmen Murray (Award-winning digital expert and Founder of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services, Host of The Carmen Murray Show and the co-host of the In with the Two Outsiders Podcast and International Speaker) along with her co-host John Vlismas (Former stand up comedian, now a disruptive educator and Marketing Executive  at #HenleyAfrica and corporate trainer, serial entrepreneur, International Speaker)

How Øutsiders venture into un-chartered territories — Carmen Murray and John Vlismas reflect on their Øutsiders' Journeys
Carmen Murray (Founder of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services) John Vlismas (Marketing Executive | Henley Business School)

In this authentic episode, co-hosts, John Vlismas and Carmen Murray unite after 40 days of lockdown to share their Øutsiders journey as two formidable forces and visionary thinkers during one of the most novel times of the 21st century. 

They reflect on how Øutsiders started as a philosophy, community, a podcast, and then how they joined forces as TWO Øutsiders applying their philosophy to help businesses recover, rebound, and flourish.  

Carmen and John reflect on their personal bonding experience and the lessons they've learned during this time.  They unpack the discomfort they had to face and how they had to become Houdini Masters to invent themselves out of the box of locks and chains.

Enjoy the episode!

In this episode Carmen Murray (Award-winning digital expert and Founder of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services, Host of The Carmen Murray Show and the co-host of the In with the Two Outsiders Podcast) is joined by her co-host John Vlismas (Former stand-up comedian, now a disruptive educator at #HenleyAfrica and corporate trainer, serial entrepreneur, International Speaker). They join two brave activists Cindy Gallop (Founder MakeLoveNotPorn; #MeTooAdvertising Activist and Founder IfWeRanTheWorld) together with Deon Wigget (Podcast and Author of My Only Story exposing alleged sex offenders)     

Here is a summary of the episode:
Take two activists. One is determined to convert porn consumers to respectful observers of consensual, non-exploitative love between humans - and one who relentlessly pursued his own rapist, and now promises justice for as many survivors as he can manage. A fearless and feared presence in the world of gender politics, Cindy is the epitome of formidable. Deon is a goofy, empathetic and articulate storyteller, and we’re instantly thrilled we could bring them together. 

The conversation is rapid-fire  - but what emerges is the diamond-like exteriors and then sudden deep empathy and kindness.  They understand that the human-animal has an almost infinite capacity for darkness - and affinity for light. 

Instead of polarity, they preach conscious inclusion. Authenticity and audacity are flying off the walls as the conversation hits nerves and bounces off taboos.

<p>
In this episode Faith Popcorn (World-famous futurist, Founder of BrainReserve and the Nostradamus of Marketing) gives an exclusive backdrop to her life and the new horizon that awaits the human race.  

She chats to Carmen Murray (Award-winning digital expert and Founder of Boo-Yah! Modern Marketing Services, Host of The Carmen Murray Show and the co-host of the In with the Two Outsiders Podcast and International Speaker) along with her co-host John Vlismas (Former stand up comedian, now disruptive educator at #HenleyAfrica and corporate trainer, serial entrepreneur, International Speaker)

This episode unfolds and takes an unexpected turn as we get to know the real Faith Popcorn, her journey to the top and secrets how you can predict the future and so much more.  

Here is a summary of what goes down in this episode:

Ms Popcorn is losing faith. 

Why? 

She’s reading the signs of the times and she says we are living in the age of narcissism.  Men are threatened by their own achievements - accelerating into a dangerous future. 

It's not all bad - Existential crisis of peacocks forcing reflection and fluidity so a sense of gender community may not be the key anymore - fluidity is. 

She insists to drive macro change by starting with a kid. “each takes one child” and openly shares the story behind the adoption of her children.  Faith mentions how her first daughter saved her from herself and gave her heart back.  Her side gig is one child at a time.  She says, ""They get it, they get love, they get kindness, they get care.""

Popcorn then gets into AI and how it is an extension of us - this is why we have to scrub ourselves and make sure AI is scrubbed too. Governments should insist on clear AI the way we aim for clean water and air.  

Seeing the future isn’t hard if you’re smart - it just takes thought. What you need to do is come back to the present and start looking for signs and signals to confirm. 

Faith jokes that she has abandonment issues, and like a pair of empathy bloodhounds, we sniff out her past, something she says she’s never been asked about and is really stumped by Carmen’s brilliant question.

A little girl ripped from her beloved Jewish New Yorker Bubba and Zeida and deposited in a catholic convent in Hong Kong by her CIA dad - we’re not surprised that she morphed into Faith Popcorn, and never stopped hunting the cause of her spy dad’s mysterious death.

<p>
In this episode Prof.Jonathan Jansen (Stellenbosch University | Professor in the Faculty of Education, known for his strong views on transformation, peaceful reconciliation and unity, and education activism) talks to co-hosts John Vlismas (Disruptive Educator, Entrepreneur, Public Speaker) and Carmen Murray (Entrepreneur, Marketing Maven, Public Speaker) about why he considers himself as an Outsider and shares an insight into his views, never heard before.

Here is a brief summary:

Imagine Yoda and our constitution had a baby.  I know, it’s messy, but it’s not.  This guest would be it.  He is amazing. He is a beautiful mix of irreverence and humility wrapped around a core of competence and commitment.  This Professor walks on the high wire between high academic towers and absolute street level.  He is incredible.  His XRay vision cuts through the smoke and mirrors.  Things like politics and prejudice.  He sees straight through it.  It’s unbelievable.  Imagine he had a ""light-saver"", and when you press it, it just beams smiling and happiness, shoot out and make a blade that cuts through all that ""kak"".  So he sees exactly what's facing our South African learners and he knows what's gotta be done.  He is blunt and sharp.  He is very passionate but very calm and he is very crazy but his considered.  He's an incredible, human being. He is an African Jedi master.  I don’t know how else to explain him to you.  Just feel like we sat at the feet of a Zen Master.

In this interview, he finally says if they call his name, he will step into the arena of politics and try and help this country.  He bluntly says, no matter what you say about education, there is no point having a 4th Industrial Revolution when children are worried about their own safety, hygiene and their level of hunger at school. He wants to fix that first.  The future is not about AI, its about ladies from NG Kerk becoming enlightened and teaching mathematics on the streets of Elsie’s River. That is the story of our Future.

All these things make our guests amazing. A brilliant mind with a massive heart and a devotion to a work called equity, we give you... Professor Jonathan Jansen.

<p>
Join the Outsider Movement : 

In this episode Stafford Masie (Worldclass Techtrepreneur, Serial Entrepreneur, Global Speaker, Husband, Father) talks to John Vlismas (Former Comedian, Faculty Member at Henley, Global Speaker, Disruptive Thinker, Educator, and serial entrepreneur) and co-host Carmen Murray (Host of Carmen Murray Show, Entrepreneur, Global Speaker, Educator, and Marketing Ninja). 

John and Carmen explore what makes Stafford Masie an Outsider and what does life look like from the outside looking in.  

Here is a brief summary: 
There is this Rabbi, he commits an atrocity or an act of passion, we will never know. It's in 1940's Johannesburg in a suburb. What happens then is a curious family tree grows with a zero-based history.  An apple grows from that tree, he falls from the tree, and he has a deep sense of loss at his core. Kind of a hollowness.  The apple rolls away to become the most accomplished South African in the tech space.  John and Carmen have this crazy open conversation with Stafford and he talks about the stuff he never really talks about. He draws a beautifully clear line from a hominid, Latin word for a big monkey in a cave, all the way through history to a young man doing cocaine in the toilet.  I know, it doesn't make any sense. But it will.  What happens then is, he illustrates how the muddy hand print in a cave echoes an eternity. All the way down to that young boy in the toilet and now his chances of being president are ruined by a memory captured digitally. So that is the Ape that created perfect memory, now fighting for the right, to enforce the right to forget.  Finally, he understands community, attribution, and legacy.  Those are the only 3 things we need to worry about. He also talks about how millennials have re-framed value.  Whatever you think is valuable, is wrong.  You don't have to own anything, you just need access to it. That's what's actually important. He then tells us that family is the ultimate social teacher.  Stafford Masie is a curious, analytical synthesizer,  fueled by a perceived cultural constraint.

He is a superb example of an Outsider who has used negative drivers to realize massive value. 

We dare you! DON'T LISTEN TO THIS!

<p>
John Vlismas and Carmen Murray unite as two formidable forces and visionary thinkers to unlock your inner Øutsider. It's time to get off the couch into the arena, disrupt your thinking and get real in this chaotic world. Be the catalyst for change and question everything.

The one thing that makes Outsiders powerful, is the ability to turn their back to the crowds and face the music they want to create. The IN with the TWO Outsiders podcast is about two underdogs, John Vlismas and Carmen Murray who find other underdogs, misfits, professional trouble makers, activists, and uncover their underdog story looking from the outside in. They have meaningful conversations with people that are changing the way we see the world, one word, one day, one act at a time.

If you are an Underdog, then you are an Outsider. If you are a rebel, then you are an Outsider. If you are a trouble maker, you are an Outsider. If you want to expand your mind, you are an Outsider. If you are awakened, you are an Outsider.

Ask Why?
