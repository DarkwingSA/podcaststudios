No Going Back to Normal — To recover from COVID-19, activists are calling for a just recovery
Sonia Phalatse and Carilee Osborne (Institute for Economic Justice)

In this episode Sonia Phalatse and Carilee Osborne from the Institute for Economic Justice talks to Climate Justice Coalition secretary Alex Lenferna about the need for a just recovery to COVID-19. We explore why austerity will cause more pain for South Africa, and why we need to invest instead in building a more socially and ecologically just future. 

Sonia and Carilee discuss a recent report they co-authored about what a just recovery for South Africa could look like. We discuss interesting questions like how does a purple feminist economy compliment an ecologically and socially just green economy. 

We also discuss why Tito Mboweni's special budget will lead to devastating austerity. We show why the best path forward for South Africa is to instead invest in a socially and ecologically just recovery.
