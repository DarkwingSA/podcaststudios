<p>It's a messy, complicated world out there. We need better solutions to the problems around us, and better leaders to drive them.

<p>
Imagine what it takes to run 42 km. A full marathon.
Now, imagine doing so after cycling non-stop for 180 km. 
Now, imagine doing both after a 3.8 km swim. 

This is the journey every aspiring endurance triathlete must take to earn the coveted moniker of Ironman. 

Now, imagine doing all of that, in record time, with stage 4 brain cancer.

In this episode, the first of three in a series with Richard Wright, a sought-after speaker, author, endurance athlete and three-time cancer survivor, we talk about what it takes to push the boundaries of our physical and mental capability to achieve apparently impossible feats, even when all the odds are against us. 

We talk about this not just in terms of Richard's story, or the decisions we must make every day to progress and achieve, but also critically in terms of the current state of the world - a world oppressed by the fear and uncertainty of a global COVID-19 pandemic.

Simon Dingle's first love was radio, and as such is a voice that will be familiar to many. He has featured as a leading technology commentator for the best part of twenty years and is recognised today as one of South Africa's - and arguably the world's - leading and more lucid experts in Bitcoin and fintech disruption. 

In this episode we talk about the philosophy of money, incentives, the dysfunction of the central banking system, the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies, and one or two other bonus tid bits.

I count Simon one of my closest friends, someone who has been a rock and a sounding board in many key moments in my life. He spends the majority of his time now on Lettuce, a project focused on dramatically improving the world of money. Before that he was part of the teams that started 22seven, Curve, and Luno. He also wrote a book called In Math We Trust. And in case you didn't immediately gather so from the show, he is also one of the more authoritative and informative public speakers on the circuit (you should book him, immediately.)

In this episode I talk to data maven and transformation evangelist Lerato Semenya about a range of topics related to the challenge of leveraging big data for better decision-making in modern organisations. Lerato has just launched a new venture called Chromatic to assist corporations in facilitating tangible shifts in intention and application around diversity and inclusion initiatives, after a very successful career in data science with a major bank, energy company and talent management conglomerate.

I talk to Jacques Rousseau, lecturer at the University of Cape Town, author, secular activist and social commentator on his area of expertise, critical thinking and ethics. We explore the benefits of applying rational thought to leadership, the pros and cons of social media (and specifically Twitter), the lost art of conversation and debate, and many more topics.
