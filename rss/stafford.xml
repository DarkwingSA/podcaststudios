The dynamic (European) future of work — Fascinating WFH stats and insights into security challenges/opportunities
Jesper Frederiksen (Okta, Inc | Vice President and General Manager, EMEA)

Jesper and I first met when I established Google's presence here in South Africa (2006). We've been friends ever since and I've always highly regarded his insights into technology trends. Here he shares this fascinating 'Work From Home' (WFH) European study done by OKTA. The posits are fascinating and gives us some useful insights re the metamorphosis occurring right now throughout the region. His OKTA vantage point gives him frontline views of the future of work unfolding; what a privilege to hear it directly from Jesper.

Geeks Reminiscing — Looking back over aged (tech) shoulders
JD Marymee (Microsoft HQ Seattle | Applied Innovation Architect, Professional Flight Instructor and Author)

JD and I met in the USA in 1996 when I started working at Novell’s Utah (Provo) HQ. His tech background and experience is jaw-dropping! JD’s history covers some of the most pivotal technology milestones in our industry and the various pioneers he engaged during those times.

Listen in as we casually throw back to some of those fascinating instances, do some BIG name dropping and he shares his views on Blockchain.

Unfortunately I couldn’t keep him talking longer (because he had to jump on a call with NASA and Starlink) but I’m sure (the older) geeks out there will love hearing some of this tech history.

Consider this Part I : I promise to bring him back to surface more of this history chronologically. There is SO much he still has to share!

<p>
The reinventor of education — Inventive entrepreneurship, founder PTSD and next generation learning
Robert Paddock (GetSmarter | Co-founder, Valenture Institute | CEO, Hubble Studios | Executive Director, Injini | Board Member)

From a drummer who almost lost his hearing, to logistics, to compost, to disrupting the education sector; Rob shares his pathways that led to one of the biggest deals in SA's startup sector history (an exit of $103m plus $20m cash when he sold the Cape Town based education platform, GetSmarter, to a USA company, 2U, in 2017).

If you're a budding entrepreneur, this is for you; Rob has had a fascinating and meandering startup journey and he articulates so many learnings from it.

If you're a parent with kids entering/in high-school, this is for you; Rob's insights into this sector and the future he is actually building today, specifically via the Valenture Institute, every parent should heed. In this COVID-19 dispensation we are accelerating the metamorphosis of education which will have tectonic impacts on society.

If you're an experienced founder, this is for you; We share our stories of building something you've invented and then having to let it go. Posits related to psychological hardships that we simply do not expound enough as founders. (Inventive entrepreneurship can be an abyss of sacrifice, forced confrontations with your shadow and ultimately with your identity and depression(s). Everyone focuses on the success but many do not lift the veil to see the impact and consequences some founders have to wrestle long after.)

In summary; Rob is just an awesome dude and I hope this casual and unscripted conversation, which was such a privilege, holds nuggets of learnings for all.

Early childhood development and COVID-19 — Parents of toddlers - heads up! Amazing insights, guidance, and advice!
Meg Faure (Occupational Therapist, Author, Speaker and Founder of 'Play Sense')

Parents in COVID-19 lockdown (and in general) are extremely concerned about their child's development. Many of us are stuck at home with toddlers, multi-tasking, exhausted, and out of ideas. Amongst ourselves we're asking serious questions about their growth, well-being, the future of day-care and their overall education.

I turned to my favourite OT and one of the smartest educationalist on the planet; Meg Faure has done incredible work authoring best-selling books, started successful businesses in this domain and is a thought-leader.

Enjoy her sharing so many invaluable and practical nuggets of parental advice for us in lock-down (which will be equally invaluable post lock-down).

BTW, listen out for the bit where she articulates pivoting her 'Play Sense' business due to the lock-down - fascinating share and learnings every Founder out there will find useful.

The upside of down in Bruce Whitfield's world — Perspectives making sense of our new world; historically and economically
Bruce Whitfield (A multi award-winning business broadcaster, journalist, author, speaker, MC and conference facilitator)

Bruce Whitfield (@brucebusiness) doesn't need any introduction if you're a South African (for the few who don't know him; see his bio below). I love prompting Bruce for his views which are usually fascinating, verbose, contextual and wrapped in beautiful historical metaphors.

I 'cold-called' him this morning and (completely unscripted) he shared his views re the pandemic, the world economy, South Africa and where this is all heading. Wonderfully positive perspectives that left me hopeful of our future.

He also shamelessly and typically (*wink*) plugged his new best-selling book (see link below to purchase it).

Bruce's bio : A multi-platform award-winning financial journalist, Bruce’s work on radio, television and in print gives him unique access to South Africa’s biggest power brokers in business and money. He has been named ‘Financial Journalist of the Year’ three times in the past decade by independent judges in the annual Sanlam Awards, and has received recognition for his work on the economy, companies and personal finance.
</p>
<br />
<p>The article he authored that we mention <a href="https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/opinion/2020-05-13-bruce-whitfield-dear-minister-patel-let-me-tell-you-whats-unfair-/?utm_source=Solid%20Gold%20Podcast&utm_medium=Episode%20Description%20Stafford%20Unplugged">https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/opinion/2020-05-13-bruce-whitfield-dear-minister-patel-let-me-tell-you-whats-unfair-/</a></p>

Digital, Innovation, Humanity and the Virus! — True invention and innovation only exist when people are having fun
Lee Naik (TransUnion Africa | CEO | LinkedIn Top Voice | Columnist | Speaker)

Lee and I shoot the breeze on his thoughts about this new world order and where he thinks we are. We've known each other for many years so much is said between the lines but I'm sure you will enjoy the chat.

He also shares some amazing nuggets re their TransUnion findings

My key take-away : Joy, Re-invention & innovation of self is key to this new dispensation.

The economic disaster of COVID-19! — Our money, businesses and world finances are incinerating - now what?
Dr. Adrian Saville (Chief Executive at Cannon Asset Managers and Prof of Economics, Finance and Strategy at the Gordon Institute of Business Science)

Adrian is my 'go-to' person when the economic world just does not make sense - he is that for many institutions too — this discussion will show you why!

In today's upside down Covid-19 world I ask Adrian to decipher what's happening, to attempt a forecast of what lies ahead and what he would do if he were President.

I level many (controversial) questions at him including the topical and critical 'death by starvation versus death by virus?' - fascinating perspectives!

Education and governance in a COVID-19 world — Amazing insights and observations for our new and strange world!
Professor Jonathan Jansen (Distinguished Professor of Education at Stellenbosch University and President of the Academy of Science of South Africa)

Prof JJ and I casually shoot the breeze generally talking about the Corona virus, the situation globally and in South Africa, and the state of education in this new Covid-19 dispensation.

As usual the Prof's views are insightful and thought-provoking.
