<p>
In this episode Elri Wium, Executive Coach and Specialist on Nonverbal Communication, Emotion, and the Voice and Speech, speaks to Gail Cameron, the Director of the IE Group, about the important role that the voice and speech plays in the selling of ideas and your personal brand.  

In this information driven world, we tend to rely so much on our content, facts, material or data, that we tend forget about who we are presenting it to – the human. And that is where the body language, Emotional prosody, tone of voice, and modulation comes into play. This means that your content, facts, material or data might be brilliant, BUT if you cannot convey that information in an interesting way, whether in a boardroom, negotiation, presentation, interview, or even a team or staff meeting, then it will lose its effect completely and your ideas alone won’t get you anywhere. 

Therefore, in order to enhance your personal and communicative impact power in these high-stakes situations, it is imperative that you grasp the listeners attention and make yourself and the information memorable.

<p>
Perception is the only Reality others have; and their Perception is their Reality.


> Strategic Image Management and Personal Branding.

Our image management coaching focuses on Personal Branding and Image Excellence.

Personal branding is the inner perspective one needs to know about who you are, Image Excellence is the outward reflection and embodiment thereof. 

Authenticity is magnetic, if we can make the connection between the highest expression of our Personal Brand and what it would look like in the world, we start to develop a unique value proposition that is underpinned by a high degree of self-awareness and confidence. 

To guide us on this journey we use a framework that covers important elements outlining how we can enhance our personal impact power including:

- The Primacy Effect and its Criteria;
- “Enclothed” Cognition Psychology;
- Dress code for the work context;
- The Science of colour;
- Basic Body and Face shape Analysis; and
- Accessories, grooming, make up, hairstyle.



> What is Strategic Image Management?  
                      
Strategic Image Management by its very definition suggests that you can and should manage the perceptions that others have of you. Perception is the only reality. Strategic Image Management is a composite issue forming part of a holistic approach towards the way in which you communicate.

Everything about you speaks – your body language, appearance and your voice.
