Climate change: Causes, impacts, and what it means for South Africa

In this episode, hosted by Nicole Rodel from African Climate Reality Project, we cover the science and impacts of the global climate crisis - and what it means for Mzansi. 

South Africa's greenhouse gas emissions are the fourteenth highest in the world - making the country a carbon criminal. Nicole from African Climate Reality Project, together with civil society on the frontlines of climate and environmental injustice, explore how the climate crisis is connected to the socio-economic issues that many South Africans are faced with today - and what we can do to solve it.

> Samson Mokwena | Vaal Environmental Justice Alliance
> Shanice Firmin | South Durban Community Environmental Alliance
> Khulekani Fah Magwaza | South African Youth Climate Change Coalition
> Siyabonga Myeza | Environmental Monitoring Group

Have you ever heard sweeping statements during the pre-election day hype, that never quite come to fruition? Or maybe you want to find out if your elected representatives think your and your community’s needs are a priority? One way to see if our elected representatives mean what they say – and are fulfilling their mandate – is to follow the money. 

In this episode of The People’s Fix hosted by Fikile ‘DJ Fix’ Moeti, we get into the budget process, and how you can use budgets to monitor and influence your Provincial Legislature and the decisions they are making. This is how you can make sure that government is spending public money that we pay through taxes correctly and responsibly. 

With advice from South African civil society representatives, we walk you through some essential budget monitoring tips, so that you can be a more active citizen for responsive legislatures.

List of Interviewees: 
- Vusi Ngqokomashe – Land Rights Organisation of South Africa
- Siya Myeza – Environmental Monitoring Group
- Sandile Nombeni – 360 Degrees Environmental Organisation
- Thando Lukuko – Project 90 by 2030

Making your mark on election day is not the only way for you to influence government decisions. Beyond electing people to represent all citizens, the South African Constitution gives each citizen the right to be involved in decisions that will affect them or the society they live in, and to hold elected representatives and government authorities to account at all times. 

In this episode of The People’s Fix, our host Fikile ‘DJ Fix’ Moeti takes you into what public participation is and why you should be doing it, and we’ll hear what it currently looks like in practice from representatives of South African civil society organisations. With a full ‘how-to’ guide, you’ll have all the tools you need to be an active citizen for responsive legislatures.

List of interviewees:
- Francina Nkosi – Waterberg Women’s Advocacy Organisation
- Thando Lukuko – Project 90 by 2030
- Siya Myeza – Environmental Monitoring Group
- Samson Mokwena – Vaal Environmental Justice Alliance 
- Vusi Ngqokomashe – Land Rights Organisation of South Africa 
- Khulekani Magwaza – South African Youth Climate Change Coalition
- Molatelo Mohale – Nkuzi Development Association
- Sandile Nombeni – 360 Degrees Environmental Organisation
- Shanice Firmin – South Durban Community Environmental Alliance
- Desmond D’sa – South Durban Community Environmental Alliance 
- Mmathapelo Thobejane – Sekhukhune Environmental Justice Network
- Mandla Jwili – 360 Degrees Environmental Organisation
- Qedusizi Masina – 360 Degrees Environmental Organisation

South Africa’s Provincial Legislatures - the institutions mandated to represent the people - seem to be the ones that citizens understand the least and feel the most distant from. Ask yourself: do you know who represents you and your community in the Provincial Legislatures? How many of us even know how these institutions function – and why we should be engaging with them? 

In this first episode of The People’s Fix, you’ll hear from representatives of South African civil society organisations and from host Fikile ‘DJ Fix’ Moeti, about what the legislatures are, how they work, and what powers they have in the governance of South Africa. 

List of interviewees
- Vusi Ngqokomashe – Land Rights Organisation of South Africa
- Thando Lukuko – Project 90 by 2030
- Samson Mokwena – Vaal Environmental Justice Alliance
- Molly Mbangula – 360 Degrees Environmental Organisation
- Mmathapelo Thobejane – Sekhukhune Environmental Justice Network
- Francina Nkosi – Waterberg Women’s Advocacy Organisation
- Siya Myeza – Environmental Monitoring Group
- Molatelo Mohale – Nkuzi Development Association
