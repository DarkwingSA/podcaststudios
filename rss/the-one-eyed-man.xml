<p>
Can you tell from the title of this episode that I've been watching a LOT of Frozen 2 while on lock down? In this episode I talk to Andrew Blades, an uncertainty navigator and polymath, about how to lead in a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) world. 

Andrew is based out of Melbourne, Australia, and serves as the risk and and compliance manager in the state of Victoria's EPA (Environment Protection Authority). He started his professional career in the intelligence section of the Australian Air Force, focusing on planning the Force's response to ""low probability, high impact"" events, lectured in university, spent time in the private sector, and today holds four Master's degrees together with a range of certifications that match his substantial experience. 

Andrew has a truly remarkable intellect and his views on the current global COVID-19 crisis (both from a health and economic perspective) were insightful and helpful, particularly from a leadership perspective. 

Key quote:

'This (pandemic) is a systemic risk to all humans, and we're not used to thinking in terms of systemic risk - we're used to thinking in a much smaller level of risk ... I think there's a possibility ... that what we start to see out of this is people start think in a much broader (way)' -- Andrew Blades

In this episode I talk to Rapelang Rabana about the education and edtech revolution, digital transformation, and how crises can be an opportunity to radically re-calibrate corporate vision and strategy.

Rapelang is the founder and chair at Rekindle Learning, a tech entrepreneur, and a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum. We discuss in detail her start-up journey (fresh out of university), her experience of consulting to corporate clients on innovation and disruption, and the book she is currently working on. 

Key quote:

'The sting of trauma forces our minds to step out of the movie we have been living, to sit and observe for a while; it forces us to separate ourselves from what we thought was true and constant, what we perceived to be a part of our being, and question everything.'"" -- Rapelang Rabana.

<p>
Why do some companies thrive in a crisis, and others fail? 

Why does uncertainty bring the best out of some leaders, and leave others completely ineffective?

In this episode of the One-Eyed Man I talk to global speaker, serial entrepreneur and all round smart dude Richard Mulholland about what you do (as a leader, especially in business) when you don't know what to do. How do we, and how should we, make decisions in the midst of a crisis, or very uncertain circumstances?

We talk about the importance of values, of core beliefs and behaviours, and about how to cultivate these in organisations. We explore the question of whether values are discovered, or created. We debate about whether values should be aspirational or not. 

Please like, share and SUBSCRIBE! And if you're feeling very generous, perhaps rate the podcast on your local platform. And thanks again for listening.

The conclusion to my three-part discussion with Richard Wright - the metaphorical marathon portion of our show - tells the story of his journey to today. How he dealt with his second cancer diagnosis, his athletic victories under treatment, severe personal trauma and incredible personal triumph.

Episode two of our three-part series takes us further into Richard's first cancer diagnosis, using the metaphor of an Ironman triathlon. We hit our first transition, and embark on a grueling 180 km cycle together. 

Richard bares all as we discover what it feels like to be given 6 months to live, and what it takes to beat an invisible, apparently unbeatable enemy.

Imagine what it takes to run 42 km. A full marathon.
Now, imagine doing so after cycling non-stop for 180 km. 
Now, imagine doing both after a 3.8 km swim. 

This is the journey every aspiring endurance triathlete must take to earn the coveted moniker of Ironman. 

Now, imagine doing all of that, in record time, with stage 4 brain cancer.

In this episode, the first of three in a series with Richard Wright, a sought-after speaker, author, endurance athlete and three-time cancer survivor, we talk about what it takes to push the boundaries of our physical and mental capability to achieve apparently impossible feats, even when all the odds are against us. 

We talk about this not just in terms of Richard's story, or the decisions we must make every day to progress and achieve, but also critically in terms of the current state of the world - a world oppressed by the fear and uncertainty of a global COVID-19 pandemic.

Simon Dingle's first love was radio, and as such is a voice that will be familiar to many. He has featured as a leading technology commentator for the best part of twenty years and is recognised today as one of South Africa's - and arguably the world's - leading and more lucid experts in Bitcoin and fintech disruption. 

In this episode we talk about the philosophy of money, incentives, the dysfunction of the central banking system, the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies, and one or two other bonus tid bits.

I count Simon one of my closest friends, someone who has been a rock and a sounding board in many key moments in my life. He spends the majority of his time now on Lettuce, a project focused on dramatically improving the world of money. Before that he was part of the teams that started 22seven, Curve, and Luno. He also wrote a book called In Math We Trust. And in case you didn't immediately gather so from the show, he is also one of the more authoritative and informative public speakers on the circuit (you should book him, immediately.)

Simon Dingle's first love was radio, and as such is a voice that will be familiar to many. He has featured as a leading technology commentator for the best part of twenty years and is recognised today as one of South Africa's - and arguably the world's - leading and more lucid experts in Bitcoin and fintech disruption. 

In this episode we talk about the philosophy of money, incentives, the dysfunction of the central banking system, the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies, and one or two other bonus tid bits.

I count Simon one of my closest friends, someone who has been a rock and a sounding board in many key moments in my life. He spends the majority of his time now on Lettuce, a project focused on dramatically improving the world of money. Before that he was part of the teams that started 22seven, Curve, and Luno. He also wrote a book called In Math We Trust. And in case you didn't immediately gather so from the show, he is also one of the more authoritative and informative public speakers on the circuit (you should book him, immediately.)

In this episode I talk to Lerato Semenya, a data and transformation evangelist, and the founder of Chromatic Consulting, about how leaders can extract better insights out of data and analytics for a competitive advantage. 

Lerato has just launched her new venture to assist corporations in facilitating tangible shifts in intention and application around diversity and inclusion initiatives, after a very successful career in data science with a major bank, energy company, and talent management conglomerate.

Key quote:

'When we think about innovation and transporting ourselves into a future, we like to think of invention ... but it's more about understanding the context that we're in and removing the vilification of failure.'

In this episode I talk to Jacques Rousseau, lecturer at the University of Cape Town, author, and secular activist about critical thinking and ethics. 

We explore the benefits of applying rational thought to effective leadership, the pros and cons of social media (and specifically Twitter), the lost art of conversation and debate, and many more topics.

Key quote:

'No matter how big and powerful you might be, there's somebody out there that's bigger and more powerful, and unless you have tried to create a world in which we look out for each other, you're going to get taken down one day as well... ' -- Jacques Rousseau
