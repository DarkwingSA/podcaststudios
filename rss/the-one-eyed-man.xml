<p>
In this episode I speak to Professor Vasti Roodt about a theory of justice (fairness) that might be the key to building a better world for everyone, regardless of their social standing or resources. 

Vasti is an associate professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Stellenbosch, and the Head of the Unit for Social and Political Ethics in the Centre for Applied Ethics. She holds an MA and DPhil (Philosophy) from USB. Her research focuses on moral and political philosophy.

In November last year I had the opportunity to attend a leadership retreat on the beautiful Boschendal wine estate hosted by Vasti and her colleagues. The retreat was aimed at introducing the fundamental tenets of the philosophical endeavour to business executives who wanted to take a more conscious, considered look at value creation in today's complex world. She presented a model for justice based on John Rawls' A Theory of Justice (1971) which I found deeply intriguing and challenging. It wasn't my first introduction to Rawls' work, but one of the more accessible explorations of his fascinating thought experiment and proposal for a more fair society.

I really enjoyed the retreat and have stayed in touch with the faculty since. 

Key quote:

'What could ever be the justification for suggesting that one person deserves to be more free than another?' -- Prof Vasti Roodt

<p>
In this episode I talk to Dean McCoubrey about how to be a better parent to digitally connected children. 

Dean is a successful media entrepreneur and the founder of MySociaLife (www.mysocialife.com), an education company that examines the invisible physiological, emotional, mental and neurological influences of working on smart devices and in social media, and equips caregivers and educators with the tools to empower children for smarter internet usage. 

We discuss the story of his personal journey from professional burnout into therapy and the discovery of new purpose in helping young people navigate their digital decision-making with more intention and responsibility. We also discuss some practical tips for parents looking to improve their relationship with their teenagers, and specifically in regards to their online activity. 

Key quote:

'This profound well of experience that sits inside you will respond to all sorts of stimuli and make you behave in a certain way, and that can get you intro trouble. So you need to understand partly yourself, and partly the stimulus.' -- Dean McCoubrey

Can you tell from the title of this episode that I've been watching a LOT of Frozen 2 while on lock down? In this episode I talk to Andrew Blades, an uncertainty navigator and polymath, about how to lead in a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) world. 

Andrew is based out of Melbourne, Australia, and serves as the risk and and compliance manager in the state of Victoria's EPA (Environment Protection Authority). He started his professional career in the intelligence section of the Australian Air Force, focusing on planning the Force's response to ""low probability, high impact"" events, lectured in university, spent time in the private sector, and today holds four Master's degrees together with a range of certifications that match his substantial experience. 

Andrew has a truly remarkable intellect and his views on the current global COVID-19 crisis (both from a health and economic perspective) were insightful and helpful, particularly from a leadership perspective. 

Key quote:

'This (pandemic) is a systemic risk to all humans, and we're not used to thinking in terms of systemic risk - we're used to thinking in a much smaller level of risk ... I think there's a possibility ... that what we start to see out of this is people start think in a much broader (way)' -- Andrew Blades

I think there's a possibility ... that what we start to see out of this is people start think in a much broader (way)' -- Andrew Blades

<p>
In this episode I talk to Rapelang Rabana about the education and edtech revolution, digital transformation, and how crises can be an opportunity to radically re-calibrate corporate vision and strategy.

Rapelang is the founder and chair at Rekindle Learning, a tech entrepreneur, and a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum. We discuss in detail her start-up journey (fresh out of university), her experience of consulting to corporate clients on innovation and disruption, and the book she is currently working on. 

Key quote:

'The sting of trauma forces our minds to step out of the movie we have been living, to sit and observe for a while; it forces us to separate ourselves from what we thought was true and constant, what we perceived to be a part of our being, and question everything.'"" -- Rapelang Rabana.

<p>
Why do some companies thrive in a crisis, and others fail? 

Why does uncertainty bring the best out of some leaders, and leave others completely ineffective?

In this episode of the One-Eyed Man I talk to global speaker, serial entrepreneur and all round smart dude Richard Mulholland about what you do (as a leader, especially in business) when you don't know what to do. How do we, and how should we, make decisions in the midst of a crisis, or very uncertain circumstances?

We talk about the importance of values, of core beliefs and behaviours, and about how to cultivate these in organisations. We explore the question of whether values are discovered, or created. We debate about whether values should be aspirational or not.

<p>
Episode two of our three-part series takes us further into Richard's first cancer diagnosis, using the metaphor of an Ironman triathlon. We hit our first transition, and embark on a grueling 180 km cycle together. 

Richard bares all as we discover what it feels like to be given 6 months to live, and what it takes to beat an invisible, apparently unbeatable enemy.

Episode two of our three-part series takes us further into Richard's first cancer diagnosis, using the metaphor of an Ironman triathlon. We hit our first transition, and embark on a grueling 180 km cycle together. 

Richard bares all as we discover what it feels like to be given 6 months to live, and what it takes to beat an invisible, apparently unbeatable enemy.

Imagine what it takes to run 42 km. A full marathon.
Now, imagine doing so after cycling non-stop for 180 km. 
Now, imagine doing both after a 3.8 km swim. 

This is the journey every aspiring endurance triathlete must take to earn the coveted moniker of Ironman. 

Now, imagine doing all of that, in record time, with stage 4 brain cancer.

In this episode, the first of three in a series with Richard Wright, a sought-after speaker, author, endurance athlete and three-time cancer survivor, we talk about what it takes to push the boundaries of our physical and mental capability to achieve apparently impossible feats, even when all the odds are against us. 

We talk about this not just in terms of Richard's story, or the decisions we must make every day to progress and achieve, but also critically in terms of the current state of the world - a world oppressed by the fear and uncertainty of a global COVID-19 pandemic.

Myths, money and misinformation — A deep(er) dive into Bitcoin and blockchain technology

In this episode I talk to Simon Dingle, CEO of Inves Capital and Lettuce, about the philosophy of money, incentives, the dysfunction of the central banking system, the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies and more.

Simon is a dear friend, someone who has been a rock and a sounding board in many key moments in my life. Before Lettuce he was part of the teams that started 22seven, Curve, and Luno. He wrote a book called In Math We Trust, and in case you didn't immediately gather so from the show, he is also one of the more authoritative and informative public speakers on the circuit.

A new brand of leadership — Lessons and learnings from the bleeding edge of leadership development.

In this episode I talk to Sam Rockey, co-founder of Thompson Harrison, a London-based leadership and organisational development consulting business. 

We talk about the questions modern leaders are being forced to ask to stay relevant, the value of an appreciation for complexity and nuance, and some of the key forces driving changes in leadership dynamics the world over.

Key quote:

'Globalisation has made all of our (leadership) problems common, and consistent.' -- Sam Rockey

In this episode I talk to Lerato Semenya, a data and transformation evangelist, and the founder of Chromatic Consulting, about how leaders can extract better insights out of data and analytics for a competitive advantage. 

Lerato has just launched her new venture to assist corporations in facilitating tangible shifts in intention and application around diversity and inclusion initiatives, after a very successful career in data science with a major bank, energy company, and talent management conglomerate.

Key quote:

'When we think about innovation and transporting ourselves into a future, we like to think of invention ... but it's more about understanding the context that we're in and removing the vilification of failure.'

I talk to Jacques Rousseau, lecturer at the University of Cape Town, author, secular activist and social commentator on his area of expertise, critical thinking and ethics. We explore the benefits of applying rational thought to leadership, the pros and cons of social media (and specifically Twitter), the lost art of conversation and debate, and many more topics.
