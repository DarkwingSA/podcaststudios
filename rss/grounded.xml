October is the month of the King (or should that be Queen) of the plant world to make themselves known in SA. 

Roses are the plant that conjure up visions of love, not just through their good looks, but the memories their scent evoke... 

Long thought by many to be particularly pernickity, difficult to grow and in need of far too much attention, Roses have proven their worth in water scarce gardens around the country. As one of the top Rose breeders in the country, Anja Taschner demystifies the lore of these beauties, and tells us more about the latest Named Rose to come from their stable in honour of Thuli Madonsela.

Getting the garden ready for spring is what Life is a Garden has on its menu, and Cary Goodwin gives us all the hints and tips we'll need to ensure a glorious show in the upcoming months. As well as some ways to keep little hands busy during the school holidays.

Making as small an impact on the environment is something we should all be aware of. And children are getting in on the action, not taking their lead from the wasteful generation ahead of them. Roots and Shoots, an organisation created by Chimpanzee saviour - and now global eco warrior,Jane Goodall, has been implementing projects aimed at getting children involved in recycling, upcycling and all things environmental, not just in SA, but across the world. National coordinator for the South African arm of the organisation, Rita Groenewald, gives us the Good News from their perspective, and ideas on how we can all get involved.

Bright Blue Swimming Pools are a dated symbol of pride. Along with swathes of lawn - those 'green deserts' that so many people spend so much time and money and water on - chlorinated or saline pools are on their way out. Rather than filling in a pool which you just seem to be filling with money and chemicals, rather consider being eco-chic and converting it into a wetland wonderland. One-time architect, Anthony Philbrick, explains what goes into creating one, and why we should be kinder to the environment, and ourselves.

<p>
In this episode Adolph van Der Westhuizen (Sales and Marketing Manager Reinforced Hosing and Watex) talks to host Melanie Walker about the benefits of vertical gardening. How small spaces are given and can give life to a dull area life by creating living walls. With the Watex Expandable Green Wall Kit you can enhance that area that is crying out for a bit of TLC and life. The kit is easy to install, it has its own drip irrigation system with the option to attach to a hose pipe, its neat and clean looking as well as robust in its durability. The wonderful thing about the Watex Expandable Green Wall Kit is that should you be in a rental all you have to do is unclip it from its bracket supplied or if you want to move your wall kit to another spot it is as simple as 1 2 3. The kits are ideal for grow and eat plants. Vertical gardens are fantastic towards helping towards climate change and also if you don’t want your pets peeing on your herbs and leafy greens.

According to the SA State of Waste Report, in 2017 South Africans generated 42 million tons of general waste. Only 4.9 million tons of that were recycled. We have one of the worst recycling rates in the world. It's no longer up to the government or municipalities to deal with the waste WE'RE creating - it's up to us to get with the recycling programme. But do you know the difference between reusing, recycling and upcycling? Not? Then listen here! You can be the difference you want to see in the world...

No longer the preserve of the green and greyish brown, the winter garden will warm even the most stony cockles of the heart. If you're wondering how to bring colour and warmth back into your life during the drab colder months, look no further than the 4 Ps. Poppies, pansies, primulas and petunias will be your best bets... Well, through in a few other Ps, like Sweet Peas and a VIP - violas - and you've got a smorgasbord of deliciousness. Peter gives us all the tips you need to ensure floriferousness and longevity from all these very giving and forgiving beauties.

Bombshelter Beast are hot favourites bringing some madcap energy to SA music.  The group, originally formed by South African jazz legend Marcus Wyatt in 2015, has grown to include a real mengelmoes of musicians playing everything from jazzy-classical with an operatic aria twist, to kwaito rock mix and Zulu rap. This is an immersive experience, not just going to listen to another band! Marcus let's us know what it's all about and what they're up to next. Don't miss it.

Bombshelter Beast are hot favourites bringing some madcap energy to SA music.  The group, originally formed by South African jazz legend Marcus Wyatt in 2015, has grown to include a real mengelmoes of musicians playing everything from jazzy-classical with an operatic aria twist, to kwaito rock mix and Zulu rap. This is an immersive experience, not just going to listen to another band! Marcus let's us know what it's all about and what they're up to next. Don't miss it.

We're used to hearing about how well our Kirstenbosch and Durban exhibits have done at events like the Chelsea Flower Show. Now it's time to bring them home - and make the Joburg Flower Show an event to make other countries green with envy. For five glorious days, Waterfall City will be hosting some of the top garden designers and plant and floral experts from not just all around SA, but from the garden stars overseas. Mike Sham, organised of the event, lets us know here on Grounded just how it's all going to work, and what we can expect in late October. Www.joburgflowershow.co.za

Slightly cooler mornings and evenings may be heralding the beginning of autumn around the country, but the sun is still hot and sitting high in the sky, with no great hurry to set at the end of the day, so we should make the most of this beautiful weather by nurturing our gardens. If you can't wait to get your hands dirty, Cary Goodwin of Life is a Garden has a great guide to what you should be planting and doing in your outdoor rooms. Stars of the month are Tulbaghia (wild garlic). Pride of India and Hibiscus. There's hints on how to get and keep your pets healthy with herbs, and tips on how to keep little hands busy during the school holidays. www.lifeisagarden.co.za

The Polyphagus Shothole Borer (PSHB) (Euwallacea fornicatus - and isn't that just a fitting name for the little fornicator) - or the Vietnamese borer as many know it - has been causing the death of many trees, not just in Johannesburg, but around the rest of the country. And it’s finally getting serious ‘airtime’ in the press and social media, even though Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo have put forward a press release which was published recently in the Rosebank Killarney Gazette to say that ‘it’s too early to classify the outbreak of PSHB as a disaster’ due to a lack of data, and that they reckon we’re at the ‘tail-end of the outbreak’... and guided by research findings they hope to confirm that this outbreak is on its way out. Well, unfortunately that’s not so. The ‘outbreak’ was given wide coverage a year or more ago, and unfortunately, no cure for it has been found, and even more disturbingly, CoJ has yet to identify a place or put in place plans to get rid of infected wood. We are looking at what could potentially be one of SA’s largest ecological tragedies. The private sector has done so much in creating public awareness. Arborists are also getting on board to help find a solution. And it’s time for us to do our part too. One of SA's top arborists and tree surgeons, Julian Ortlepp gives us the background, and advice on how we can help to minimise this potential disaster.

Show gardens are probably the best way for people to get great ideas on how to bling up their outdoor spaces. And a touch of je ne  sais quois is on offer in this year's 7 French inspired spaces. Celebrating the 500th anniversary of the Renaissance, students under the tutelage of master designer Mike Rickhoff have encapsulated various aspects of French joie de vivre. From the rolling lavender fields, to pavement cafes around a town square and contemporary rooftop living, there's inspiration aplenty. The gardens are on show until the end of May, so plenty of time to visit them. And if you aren't able to, we discuss ways to bring that special esprit into your backyard

If you ever wondered if magic happens, all you need to do is look to seeds. That's what Sean Freeman of <a href=https://livingseeds.co.za/?utm_source=Solid%20Gold%20Podcast">Living Seeds</a> found out and is spreading the word on his internet based resource. The story behind Livingseeds goes back over 30 years. As a young boy Sean remembers collecting seeds, if he came across a tree that was shedding seed pods or wild flower in seed, he’d collect the seeds and store them in a small wooden box. This wooden box (which he still has) amassed a surprisingly large collection of assorted and unknown seeds over many years.  None were catalogued or named and he could only identify a handful of the really distinctive ones, the rest were indiscriminate and held his dream of germinating them.... one day. He kept them just for the idea that they could literally grow into trees or plants that could one day be used in his garden. It was the romance of ‘growing a garden from scratch’ that kept him collecting. That and the idea that there exists the potential of life and the ability of giving sustenance in every single seed. Fast forward, and the fascination became a life. Livingseeds started off in 2009 with only 34 varieties on their website (although there were only 17 in stock). They now list over 400 varieties and grow well over 600 varieties on their own property every year. If you're fascinated by the possiblities of growing your own, using open pollinated varieties, don't miss this episode of Grounded...

One of the most asked questions people in the Green Industry face (other than how to look after a lemon tree!) is how do you get rid of pests in the garden without getting rid of everything else too?

Jonathan Haw of EcoSolutions Urban Ecology specialises in integrated pest management, focused on all areas of non-toxic, effective and sustainable pest control. From rats in your kitchen to bats in your belfry, they have measures that will ensure you don't poison your environment or all the good critters you'd like to invite in. 

And keen to bring owls to your area? (You want to know hoo hoo who tells them where the boxes are?) Jonathan is full of great information and ideas on how to be eco-sensitive and a friend to all feathered (and furry) friends.
