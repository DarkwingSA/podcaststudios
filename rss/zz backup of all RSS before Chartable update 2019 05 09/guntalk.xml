Welcome to Gun Talk. The GOSA (Gun Owners South Africa) podcast that answers your FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) relating to firearm ownership in South Africa.

In this episode Paul Oxley (GOSA Chairman) will tell you more about how long you can expect to wait to receive your licence card. And what you should do if it’s delayed.


If you are a South African who lawfully owns a firearm, you are us... and we are you. We are the blanket organisation for all of the Provincial GOSAs, the Municipal GOSAs, and the Ward GOSAs.

Our principles are simple:
- Firearms in private hands are essential to public safety and democracy
- We stand for ALL lawful firearm owners
- Every firearm owner must let his or her voice be heard
- We will not condone any illegal activity
- No personal attacks against anybody at all

We strongly recommend reading and familiarising yourself with the FIREARMS CONTROL ACT 60 OF 2000 and the Firearms Control Regulations, 2004, both available in the files section of the group, and all approved amendments.

If you're not already following us on Facebook, please join now as this is the best place to get up-to-date news and information.
