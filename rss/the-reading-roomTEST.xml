The Journey Man — Travels through the world of reporter Chris Marais
Chris Marais (Author | Reporter | Brains behind KarooSpace.co.za)

How many of you remember Scope magazine? That ‘raunchy’ mag with great writing from back in the day? Or Style? A paean to gorgeousness in the 80s and 90s... 

Great journalism comes in sometimes surprising places, and one who contributed greatly to their popularity is Chris Marais. In his time, Chris has been a deadline-crazy newspaper reporter for some top South African titles (including the Rand Daily Mail), a magazine investigative journalist (Scope Magazine) and editor (Living Africa Magazine), winning a number of media awards along the way. 

He and wife Julienne du Toit currently live and work in Cradock in the Karoo, South Africa’s magical dry heartland, where they own and manage KarooSpace.co.za - the region’s premier website.

They have over the years created articles for local and offshore print and online publications that include SA Country Life, Sawubona, High Life (British Airways in-flight), Sunday Times (Johannesburg) Travel, The Guardian (UK) and Wild Magazine (SA National Parks). 

Now self-publishing their glorious range of books about the Karoo, we catch up with Chris in the Heartland to find out about his start in the business and hear more about their upcoming book, Karoo Roads. 

Books by Chris Marais and Julienne du Toit:

A Drink of Dry Land – Journeys through Namibia, Namibia Space, Shorelines – A Journey along the South African Coast, Coast to Coast, 101 Beloved Bars of Southern Africa (with Pat Hopkins), Karoo Keepsakes, Karoo Keepsakes II, The Journey Man – A South African Reporter’s Stories (Chris) and Road Tripper – Eastern Cape Karoo.

Just Doing it with David Bullard — He’s been Out To Lunch for Years!
David Bullard (Columnist | Author | TV Presenter | Celebrity Public Speaker)

Known for his controversial satire, David Bullard, SA's voice of calm in a time of faux outrage, takes no prisoners when he takes people out to lunch. 

With his penchant for creating furores at every opportunity, mainly through his widely read column, ‘Out to Lunch’, Bullard has taken on new media and Woke wannabe ‘Rock stars’ with gusto on Twitter, even causing a storm in the South African blogosphere by describing blogging as the 'air guitars of journalism... cobbled together by people who wouldn't stand a hope in hell of getting a job in journalism.'

We catch up with the Prof of Applied Histrionics at UTS (and Columnist for PoliticsWeb‬) to see who he’s been plying with wine - and if he is actually all fluffy inside.

Pedants of the world - Revolt! — Making peace with a piece is not as piquing as sneaky peaking
Sue de Groot (Sunday Times and Times Live | Deputy Features Editor and Columnist)

Autocorrect: making Twitter pedants delete and re-tweet since 2007 - Cassandra Page

Pedantry
attitude; human behaviour, displaying obsession with detail or process, often negatively perceived

For the Grammar Nazis and busy spelling-bees out there, Sue de Groot’s ‘Pedant Class’ in the Sunday Times was a main reason for buying the paper. 

Now found on the Times Select website, she continues to enthral us with her ‘Word in the Hand’ column. 

The English language - as she should be spoken - is a wonderful world of twists and turns, of words that can be bent to your will. But only when done proper like! 

We sit down with the self-confessed word nerd and ace columnist to discover what’s getting her hot under the collar.

Pedants of the world - Revolt! — Making peace with a piece is not as piquing as sneaky peaking
Sue de Groot (Sunday Times and Times Live | Deputy Features Editor and Columnist)

Autocorrect: making Twitter pedants delete and re-tweet since 2007 - Cassandra Page

Pedantry
attitude; human behaviour, displaying obsession with detail or process, often negatively perceived

For the Grammar Nazis and busy spelling-bees out there, Sue de Groot’s ‘Pedant Class’ in the Sunday Times was a main reason for buying the paper. 

Now found on the Times Select website, she continues to enthral us with her ‘Word in the Hand’ column. 

The English language - as she should be spoken - is a wonderful world of twists and turns, of words that can be bent to your will. But only when done proper like! 

We sit down with the self-confessed word nerd and ace columnist to discover what’s getting her hot under the collar.

It’s Electrifying! — Digital Graffiti from Gus Silber’s Wall
Gus Silber (Journalist | Author | Scriptwriter | Speechwriter | TweetWriter)

Over the last few years, columnist, scriptwriter and author Gus Silber has written some extraordinary commentary pieces on his journeys around his neighbourhood in Johannesburg and his digital wanderings through the global village we call social media, and posted them to Facebook. 

This latest tour de force, Electric Graffiti: Musings on a Facebook Wall, takes us on a magical mystery tour around what words and thoughts mean when cobbled together in ‘sound bytes’.
