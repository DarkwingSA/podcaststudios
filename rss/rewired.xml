Can South Africa Reimagine Economic Policy after 26 years of Democracy — Why has South Africa failed to transform its economy?
Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi

During this episode, we have a conversation with Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi who served as a cabinet minister between 1996 and 2008. We explore social and macroeconomic policies during the first 15 years of democracy. We ask her how South Africa can recover from its deepest economic depression in a century.

Can we afford NOT to have a BIG in South Africa? — Pilots, multipliers and Covid- recovery stimulus - let the evidence lead
Guy Standing (Professorial Research Associate, SOAS University of London and co-Founder of BIEN)

In this episode, Guy Standing, internationally renown expert and widely published author on BIG speaks to Duma and Isobel about his experience as advisor to  President Mandela on labour market issues, as well as his view that South Africa CANNOT afford not to have a universal Basic Income Grant (UBIG) both as a recovery stimulus but also as a central pillar of a sustainable future. He references his reasons to the many UBIG pilot studies that he has undertaken in four continents. Highly topical and extremely interesting to listen to: this episode is an historic marker in South Africa's policy deliberations.

Does South Africa need more Austerity or a Fiscal Stimulus? — Can SA Reimagine Fiscal Policy in the wake of the Covid-19 depression?
Busi Sibeko (Institute for Economic Justice | Researcher)

In this episode Busi Sibeko talks to Duma Gqubule and Isobel Frye about reimagining a Rewired fiscal policy in the wake of the Covid-19 economic depression. The conversation details the inadequacy of the stimulus package announced by the state on top of the austerity path already embarked on pre-Covid. The constitutional obligations on the state to adhere to human rights standards frames this episode that is remarkable in the breadth and depth of the analysis.

Monetary policy shibboleths and sacred cows — Understanding how past bad orthodox monetary policies must change
Owen Willcox | Oxford Policy Management

In this episode, Owen Willcox (formerly National Treasury and now with Oxford Policy Management) talks to hosts Isobel Frye and Duma Gqubule about the choices made around monetary policy and how this might have led to low economic growth and successive economic recessions. Owen and Duma unpack the economics of Quantitative Easing and we explore the political economy behind the feasibility of pro-poor post-Covid change.
