Season 2 - Trailer — The Comeback Is Always Greater than the Setback

Whoever said this deserves a medal of honor.

We are back and thrilled to share yet another season of fun content with our listeners. 

This season, we come bearing strong and beautiful guests - so, brace yourself for loads of fun, relatable, real, open and brave conversations as we dive deep into topics like - mental health, gender-based violence, the feminist divide, and why we all need to get on the same page as gen Z (so they say).

We are your one-stop source for relatable, African, female edutainment.

What a time to be alive, three months into 2020 and we have survived the unthinkable. Pandemic or not, let's keep positive. 

Stay home and Netflix or maybe spring clean or finally get into that book!

Spend time with loved ones! You may finally have time to catch up with friends on the phone, video call, catch up and have a meaningful conversation. 

Dominique and Carla chit chat about a topic that is dear to them - Carla reveals some of the challenges of growing up 'mixed-ish' in South Africa. A topic to be furthered on the show in the weeks to come. 

They celebrate the woman of the moment - Pearl Thusi on Netflix's first African Original 'Queen Sono'. Dominique reveals that she found it profound to see a female action lead doing her thing with a full-blown, beautiful afro. 

Fifteen years of friendship and they are still getting to know each other.
Are you still friends with your primary or high school mates?

<p>
Hey Limitless Fam. We love random chit chats and in this episode, we are just happy to have Lebo back in the pod with us. This is literally our first catch-up episode, all together! 

Carla gets deep into her thoughts about the reality show ""Real Housewives of Johannesburg""... maybe a little too deep. 

We discuss the rise of ""celebrity vulnerable confessions"", we are so torn, we are simply struggling to figure out if these are genuine expressions of vulnerability or just a publicity stunt for more album sales? 

We did warn you and it's in our tagline, sometimes, we are going to have fun, light and sometimes overly dumb conversations. This is our way of maintaining balance and having fun in between the growing and developing. 

The Limitless Podcast is very much an independent vehicle that runs on the support of our incredible listeners - that's you! So, if you’d like to support the show, we would like that very much. Hit ‘subscribe’ on Apple Podcasts or ‘follow’ on Spotify, and leave a review if you’re feeling especially generous. Then sit back and bask in our eternal, abundant love. Your hosts are Carla Fernandes (@carlaxiii), Dominique Reeby (@dominiqueiam) and Lebo Ndaba (@leboga)

Hey Limitless Fam. 

We are so amped to get this year into gear. We are dreaming BIG and manifesting beyond our wildest imaginations. Why not?! Give yourself permission to dream it real. 

Getting mentally and emotionally fit to tackle your dreams and wants is key. 
Maybe you are a vision board kind of person, or maybe goal lists better suit you. Whatever works for you do more of that. 

Do what you need to do to give you that edge and keep you motivated and inspired. 

In this episode, Dominique and Carla are in the pod, setting the tone for the podcast this year. We are bringing it on! Super cool guests: trailblazers, thought leaders and trend makers. 

We look forward to an amazing year with you. 

The Limitless Podcast is very much an independent vehicle that runs on the support of our incredible listeners - that's you! So, if you’d like to support the show, we would like that very much. Hit ‘subscribe’ on Apple Podcasts or ‘follow’ on Spotify, and leave a review if you’re feeling especially generous. Then sit back and bask in our eternal, abundant love. 

Your hosts are Carla Fernandes (@carlaxiii), Dominique reeby (@dominiqueiam) and Lebo Ndaba (@leboga)

Our very first episode and we get right into it!

We come with weeks' worth of baggage.

In this episode: We unpack a little about ourselves as well as a few trending topics of the week - #KFCProposal and how Twitter finally came together for the greater good.

The men behind the nation-building, how SA winning the Rugby World Cup resulted in uber-friendliness on the road. 

Dominique spills the beans on her adventures and the backlash received when shared with work-mates and Lebo reveals her 'dark' secret. 

Have we left you wanting to hear more?
Then hit 'SUBSCRIBE' now.
