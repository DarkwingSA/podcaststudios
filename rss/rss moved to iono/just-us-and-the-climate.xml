<p>
Environmental Conflict: Cause and Effect — What happens when conflict arises from depleting natural resources
Thando Lukuko (Mansa advisory | Director) Rev. Oscar Siwali (SADRA | Director)

The show will look at the impacts of climate change policy decisions for frontline communities across Southern Africa. We will explore what climate science predicts for the region and what it means for the populations living in those areas. Specifically, the show focuses on the intersectionality between depleting natural resources (water, food insecurity etc.), livelihoods and the conflicts which may arise as a result. We will provide suggestions on how to mediate those conflicts and a means to get support should the need arise.

Women on the frontlines — Exploring gender and climate justice
Alex Lenferna (350Africa.org) Mpai Nkali (Women Affected by Mining United in Action) Francina Nkosi (Waterberg Women's Advocacy Organisation)

Join us as we explore climate, environmental and gender justice for women on the frontlines of extractive and polluting industries. Francina shares her experiences and insights living next to one of the world's biggest coal power stations in Lephalale, Limpopo. Mpai tells us about what it's like living with the toxic legacies left behind by mines in Welkom in the Free State. Together we explore questions like, what is a just transition, why do communities need free prior informed consent, and much more.

They don't really care about us: Climate Justice now! — Young climate justice activists want schools to teach about climate change
Boitumelo Masipa (Section27) Raeesah Noor Mahomed (Parktown Girls) Awande Duma (SA YCCC )  Liyema Saliwa (Equal Education | Equaliser)

In this episode, we explore the intersection between the right to basic education and climate. Speaking with three young climate justice activists, we hear about how the school curriculum doesn't pay enough attention to issues around climate change or how climate change can be understood in the context of other topics and subjects. Young climate justice activists are ultimately frustrated that they seem to care about climate justice more than those in charge of climate and environmental affairs. Tune in to hear what the message these brilliant young activists have for governments and leaders.

Women and Water: Human Rights in Jeopardy — Unpacking the impact of South Africa's water woes on women
Jennifer Wells (Amnesty International | Campaigner) Nabeelah Mia (Centre for Environmental Rights | Attorney) Tatenda Muponde (Centre for Environmental Rights | Candidate Attorney)

In this episode, Jennifer Wells (campaigner for Amnesty International South Africa) talks to an all-star female line up as she welcomes guests Nabeelah Mia and Tatenda Muponde from the Centre for Environmental Rights to the podcast. The right to water is enshrined in our constitution, however it is still not enjoyed by many in this country.

> Is climate change impacting our water?
> What does it mean to be a water scarce country?
> How is the right to water enjoyed differently by different genders?
> How has the COVID pandemic exacerbated inequalities?

This episode takes a deep dive in to the relationship between climate, the right to water and women. We explore the legal framework surrounding water in South Africa and unpack what it means to enjoy the right to water as a woman in this country.

Khodani Mulaudzi (WWF South Africa | Research and Project coordinator) Vhalinavho Khavhagali (Palladium | South Africa Country Facilitator - Climate and Environment) Pfunzo Mudau (British High Commission | Policy and Campaigns Officer - Climate Change and Energy)

The episode aims to make climate change information accessible by presenting the episode in a local language, Tshivenda.

In this episode, we speak with few members from the Climate Justice Coalition (CJC) who tell us more about the work about the CJC and share a glimpse into upcoming episodes of the 'Just Us and the Climate' podcast series. Representing different South African communities and organisations, our speakers highlight the climate challenges that face vulnerable communities and contend with whether the South Africa government and industries are taking the climate crisis seriously.

No To Austerity, We Need a Just Recovery — To recover from COVID-19 activists are calling for a just recovery
Alex Lenferna (350Africa.org) Sonia Phalatse (Institute for Economic Justice) Carilee Osborne (Institute for Economic Justice)

In this episode Sonia Phalatse and Carilee Osborne from the Institute for Economic Justice talks to Climate Justice Coalition secretary Alex Lenferna about the need for a just recovery to COVID-19. We explore why austerity will cause more pain for South Africa, and why we need to invest instead in building a more socially and ecologically just future. 

Sonia and Carilee discuss a recent report they co-authored about what a just recovery for South Africa could look like. We discuss interesting questions like how does a purple feminist economy compliment an ecologically and socially just green economy. 

We also discuss why Tito Mboweni's special budget will lead to devastating austerity. We show why the best path forward for South Africa is to instead invest in a socially and ecologically just recovery.
</p>
<br />
<p>Find out more about what a just recovery is and how you can support the call here. You can read the report and take action for a just recovery! <a href="https://JustRecovery.co.za?utm_source=Solid%20Gold%20Podcast&utm_medium=Episode%20Description%20Just%20Us%20and%20the%20Climate">https://JustRecovery.co.za</a></p>

No To Austerity, We Need a Just Recovery — To recover from COVID-19 activists are calling for a just recovery
Alex Lenferna (350Africa.org) Sonia Phalatse (Institute for Economic Justice) Carilee Osborne (Institute for Economic Justice)

In this episode Sonia Phalatse and Carilee Osborne from the Institute for Economic Justice talks to Climate Justice Coalition secretary Alex Lenferna about the need for a just recovery to COVID-19. We explore why austerity will cause more pain for South Africa, and why we need to invest instead in building a more socially and ecologically just future. 

Sonia and Carilee discuss a recent report they co-authored about what a just recovery for South Africa could look like. We discuss interesting questions like how does a purple feminist economy compliment an ecologically and socially just green economy. 

We also discuss why Tito Mboweni's special budget will lead to devastating austerity. We show why the best path forward for South Africa is to instead invest in a socially and ecologically just recovery.
