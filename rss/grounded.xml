If you ever wondered if magic happens, all you need to do is look to seeds. That's what Sean Freeman of <a href=https://livingseeds.co.za/?utm_source=Solid%20Gold%20Podcast">Living Seeds</a> found out and is spreading the word on his internet based resource. The story behind Livingseeds goes back over 30 years. As a young boy Sean remembers collecting seeds, if he came across a tree that was shedding seed pods or wild flower in seed, he’d collect the seeds and store them in a small wooden box. This wooden box (which he still has) amassed a surprisingly large collection of assorted and unknown seeds over many years.  None were catalogued or named and he could only identify a handful of the really distinctive ones, the rest were indiscriminate and held his dream of germinating them.... one day. He kept them just for the idea that they could literally grow into trees or plants that could one day be used in his garden. It was the romance of ‘growing a garden from scratch’ that kept him collecting. That and the idea that there exists the potential of life and the ability of giving sustenance in every single seed. Fast forward, and the fascination became a life. Livingseeds started off in 2009 with only 34 varieties on their website (although there were only 17 in stock). They now list over 400 varieties and grow well over 600 varieties on their own property every year. If you're fascinated by the possiblities of growing your own, using open pollinated varieties, don't miss this episode of Grounded...

One of the most asked questions people in the Green Industry face (other than how to look after a lemon tree!) is how do you get rid of pests in the garden without getting rid of everything else too?

Jonathan Haw of EcoSolutions Urban Ecology specialises in integrated pest management, focused on all areas of non-toxic, effective and sustainable pest control. From rats in your kitchen to bats in your belfry, they have measures that will ensure you don't poison your environment or all the good critters you'd like to invite in. 

And keen to bring owls to your area? (You want to know hoo hoo who tells them where the boxes are?) Jonathan is full of great information and ideas on how to be eco-sensitive and a friend to all feathered (and furry) friends.

Ever ask how and why certain varieties make it to market and others don’t. The process of trialing is how. Plant trialing is not only an integral part of the green industry but it’s important for the consumer. Testing plants in varying parts of the country allows the breeders to make better decisions about what will look good and grow in the landscape and also allows the growers to decide what works best for their business and their cultural practices.
