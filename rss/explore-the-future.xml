<p>
Where data science and fintech meet — Solving South Africa's public transport nightmare with data science
Sylvester Manganye (Olova | Co-Founder)

*WARNING* THIS EPISODE WILL INSPIRE YOU! 

In this episode Sylvester Manganye talks host Shaun Dippnall about how he came to win a R2 million entrepreneurial grant by trying to solve the problem of South Africa's difficult to navigate public transport system.

Data Science isn't just about coding and algorithms, it's about solving problems. Sylvester shares his experience of going through the Alpha Code/10X program - learning to build a business and how to define your value proposition, pitching to investors, applying lean business principles and most of all, how to solve a problem with a big idea! 

There are tons of great advice for those wanting to start a business, and how to make it sustainable. He shares how they navigated through COVID when transport came to a standstill and of course shares with us what his product OLOVA aims to achieve. We can't wait to see this brilliant idea become a reality. Take a listen.

How data is redefining our business? — Where Telkom is heading in the future
Stefan Steffen (Telkom Group | Executive for Data Science)

EXPLORE Group founder Shaun Dippnall, chats to Stefan Steffen (who heads up the data science teams across the Telkom group of companies) about how to move a legacy organisation into the future using tech led capabilities.

Stefan talks about how to recruit and build teams of data scientists from junior to senior roles and the challenges that come with that; governance and data management principles; and the fine balance between delivering fast and robust data solutions. He also gives us a glimpse into the future of South Africa's national telecommunications company with some exciting Research and Development they are working on and a new product announcement.

Be prepared to be blown away and pleasantly surprised.
